abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome with high mortality rates (\~50\%) is associated with a novel group 2c betacoronavirus designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}). We synthesized a panel of contiguous {cDNAs} that spanned the entire genome. Following contig assembly into genome-length {cDNA}, transfected full-length transcripts recovered several recombinant viruses ({rMERS}-{CoV}) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Because the wild-type {MERS}-{CoV} contains a tissue culture-adapted {T1015N} mutation in the S glycoprotein, {rMERS}-{CoV} replicated \~0.5 log less efficiently than wild-type virus. In addition, we ablated expression of the accessory protein {ORF5} ({rMERS}•{ORF5}) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein ({rMERS}-{RFP}) or deleted the entire {ORF3}, 4, and 5 accessory cluster ({rMERS}-{\DeltaORF3}-5). Recombinant {rMERS}-{CoV}, {rMERS}-{CoV}•{ORF5}, and {MERS}-{CoV}-{RFP} replicated to high titers, whereas {MERS}-{\DeltaORF3}-5 showed 1-1.5 logs reduced titer compared with {rMERS}-{CoV}. Northern blot analyses confirmed the associated molecular changes in the recombinant viruses, and sequence analysis demonstrated that {RFP} was expressed from the appropriate consensus sequence {AACGAA}. We further show dipeptidyl peptidase 4 expression, {MERS}-{CoV} replication, and {RNA} and protein synthesis in human airway epithelial cell cultures, primary lung fibroblasts, primary lung microvascular endothelial cells, and primary alveolar type {II} pneumocytes, demonstrating a much broader tissue tropism than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The availability of a {MERS}-{CoV} molecular clone, as well as recombinant viruses expressing indicator proteins, will allow for high-throughput testing of therapeutic compounds and provide a genetic platform for studying gene function and the rational design of live virus vaccines.}

abstract = {Ebola viruses remain a substantial threat to both civilian and military populations as bioweapons, during sporadic outbreaks, and from the possibility of accidental importation from endemic regions by infected individuals. Currently, no approved therapeutics exist to treat or prevent infection by Ebola viruses. Therefore, we performed an in vitro screen of Food and Drug Administration ({FDA})- and ex-{US}-approved drugs and selected molecular probes to identify drugs with antiviral activity against the type species Zaire ebolavirus ({EBOV}). From this screen, we identified a set of selective estrogen receptor modulators ({SERMs}), including clomiphene and toremifene, which act as potent inhibitors of {EBOV} infection. Anti-{EBOV} activity was confirmed for both of these {SERMs} in an in vivo mouse infection model. This anti-{EBOV} activity occurred even in the absence of detectable estrogen receptor expression, and both {SERMs} inhibited virus entry after internalization, suggesting that clomiphene and toremifene are not working through classical pathways associated with the estrogen receptor. Instead, the response appeared to be an off-target effect where the compounds interfere with a step late in viral entry and likely affect the triggering of fusion. These data support the screening of readily available approved drugs to identify therapeutics for the Ebola viruses and other infectious diseases. The {SERM} compounds described in this report are an immediately actionable class of approved drugs that can be repurposed for treatment of filovirus infections.}

abstract = {The construction and application of biological network models is an approach that offers a holistic way to understand biological processes involved in disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) is a progressive inflammatory disease of the airways for which therapeutic options currently are limited after diagnosis, even in its earliest stage. {COPD} network models are important tools to better understand the biological components and processes underlying initial disease development. With the increasing amounts of literature that are now available, crowdsourcing approaches offer new forms of collaboration for researchers to review biological findings, which can be applied to the construction and verification of complex biological networks. We report the construction of 50 biological network models relevant to lung biology and early {COPD} using an integrative systems biology and collaborative crowd-verification approach. By combining traditional literature curation with a data-driven approach that predicts molecular activities from transcriptomics data, we constructed an initial {COPD} network model set based on a previously published non-diseased lung-relevant model set. The crowd was given the opportunity to enhance and refine the networks on a website ( https://bionet.sbvimprover.com/) and to add mechanistic detail, as well as critically review existing evidence and evidence added by other users, so as to enhance the accuracy of the biological representation of the processes captured in the networks. Finally, scientists and experts in the field discussed and refined the networks during an in-person jamboree meeting. Here, we describe examples of the changes made to three of these networks: Neutrophil Signaling, Macrophage Signaling, and Th1-Th2 Signaling. We describe an innovative approach to biological network construction that combines literature and data mining and a crowdsourcing approach to generate a comprehensive set of {COPD}-relevant models that can be used to help understand the mechanisms related to lung pathobiology.

Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce. {RESULTS}: Here we present {CellNOptR}, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. {CellNOptR} features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape ({CytoCopteR}) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities. {CONCLUSIONS}: Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with {CellNOptR} are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.}

Two main approaches can be taken to derive a mathematical model from these data: training a network (obtained, e.g., from literature) to the data, or inferring the network from the data alone. Purely data-driven methods scale up poorly and have limited interpretability, whereas literature-constrained methods cannot deal with incomplete networks. {RESULTS}: We present an efficient approach, implemented in the R package {CNORfeeder}, to integrate literature-constrained and data-driven methods to infer signalling networks from perturbation experiments. Our method extends a given network with links derived from the data via various inference methods, and uses information on physical interactions of proteins to guide and validate the integration of links. We apply {CNORfeeder} to a network of growth and inflammatory signalling. We obtain a model with superior data fit in the human liver cancer {HepG2} and propose potential missing pathways. {AVAILABILITY}: {CNORfeeder} is in the process of being submitted to Bioconductor and in the meantime available at www.cellnopt.org. {CONTACT}: saezrodriguez@ebi.ac.uk {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Understanding the information-processing capabilities of signal transduction networks, how those networks are disrupted in disease, and rationally designing therapies to manipulate diseased states require systematic and accurate reconstruction of network topology. Data on networks central to human physiology, such as the inflammatory signalling networks analyzed here, are found in a multiplicity of on-line resources of pathway and interactome databases (Cancer {CellMap}, {GeneGo}, {KEGG}, {NCI}-Pathway Interactome Database ({NCI}-{PID}), {PANTHER}, Reactome, {I2D}, and {STRING}). We sought to determine whether these databases contain overlapping information and whether they can be used to construct high reliability prior knowledge networks for subsequent modeling of experimental data. {RESULTS}: We have assembled an ensemble network from multiple on-line sources representing a significant portion of all machine-readable and reconcilable human knowledge on proteins and protein interactions involved in inflammation. This ensemble network has many features expected of complex signalling networks assembled from high-throughput data: a power law distribution of both node degree and edge annotations, and topological features of a "bow tie" architecture in which diverse pathways converge on a highly conserved set of enzymatic cascades focused around {PI3K}/{AKT}, {MAPK}/{ERK}, {JAK}/{STAT}, {NF\kappaB}, and apoptotic signaling. Individual pathways exhibit "fuzzy" modularity that is statistically significant but still involving a majority of "cross-talk" interactions. However, we find that the most widely used pathway databases are highly inconsistent with respect to the actual constituents and interactions in this network. Using a set of growth factor signalling networks as examples (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor, and wingless), we find a multiplicity of network topologies in which receptors couple to downstream components through myriad alternate paths. Many of these paths are inconsistent with well-established mechanistic features of signalling networks, such as a requirement for a transmembrane receptor in sensing extracellular ligands. {CONCLUSIONS}: Wide inconsistencies among interaction databases, pathway annotations, and the numbers and identities of nodes associated with a given pathway pose a major challenge for deriving causal and mechanistic insight from network graphs. We speculate that these inconsistencies are at least partially attributable to cell, and context-specificity of cellular signal transduction, which is largely unaccounted for in available databases, but the absence of standardized vocabularies is an additional confounding factor. As a result of discrepant annotations, it is very difficult to identify biologically meaningful pathways from interactome networks a priori. However, by incorporating prior knowledge, it is possible to successively build out network complexity with high confidence from a simple linear signal transduction scaffold. Such reduced complexity networks appear suitable for use in mechanistic models while being richer and better justified than the simple linear pathways usually depicted in diagrams of signal transduction.}

In all hypertensive rat strains, {ACE2} messenger {RNA} and protein expression were markedly reduced, suggesting that ace2 is a candidate gene for this {QTL}. Targeted disruption of {ACE2} in mice results in a severe cardiac contractility defect, increased angiotensin {II} levels, and upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes in the heart. Genetic ablation of {ACE} on an {ACE2} mutant background completely rescues the cardiac phenotype. But disruption of {ACER}, a Drosophila {ACE2} homologue, results in a severe defect of heart morphogenesis.

This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic {mRNAs}. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus {HKU4} ({BtCoV}-{HKU4}) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus {HKU5} ({BtCoV}-{HKU5}), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75\% and 77\% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with {BtCoV}-{HKU4} and {BtCoV}-{HKU5}, respectively, we propose that {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from {HCoV}-{EMC} remains uncertain. {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 is the sixth coronavirus known to infect humans and the first human virus within betacoronavirus lineage C. {IMPORTANCE}: Coronaviruses are capable of infecting humans and many animal species. Most infections caused by human coronaviruses are relatively mild. However, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) caused by {SARS}-{CoV} in 2002 to 2003 and the fatal infection of a human by {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 in 2012 show that coronaviruses are able to cause severe, sometimes fatal disease in humans. We have determined the complete genome of {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 using an unbiased virus discovery approach involving next-generation sequencing techniques, which enabled subsequent state-of-the-art bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and taxonomic analyses. By establishing its complete genome sequence, {HCoV}-{EMC}/2012 was characterized as a new genotype which is closely related to bat coronaviruses that are distant from {SARS}-{CoV}. We expect that this information will be vital to rapid advancement of both clinical and vital research on this emerging pathogen.}

Although apparently not pathogenic in their reservoir hosts, some viruses from bats severely affect other mammals, including humans. Examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and Nipah and Hendra viruses. Factors underlying high viral diversity in bats are the subject of speculation. We hypothesize that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this host-virus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant of the fever response and less virulent to their natural hosts.}

While a variety of vaccine platforms have shown efficacy in young-animal models and against homologous viral strains, vaccine efficacy has not been thoroughly evaluated using highly pathogenic variants that replicate the acute end stage lung disease phenotypes seen during the human epidemic. Using an adjuvanted and an unadjuvanted double-inactivated {SARS}-{CoV} ({DIV}) vaccine, we demonstrate an eosinophilic immunopathology in aged mice comparable to that seen in mice immunized with the {SARS} nucleocapsid protein, and poor protection against a nonlethal heterologous challenge. In young and 1-year-old animals, we demonstrate that adjuvanted {DIV} vaccine provides protection against lethal disease in young animals following homologous and heterologous challenge, although enhanced immune pathology and eosinophilia are evident following heterologous challenge. In the absence of alum, {DIV} vaccine performed poorly in young animals challenged with lethal homologous or heterologous strains. In contrast, {DIV} vaccines (both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted) performed poorly in aged-animal models. Importantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication. These data raise significant concerns regarding {DIV} vaccine safety and highlight the need for additional studies of the molecular mechanisms governing {DIV}-induced eosinophilia and vaccine failure, especially in the more vulnerable aged-animal models of human disease.}

High mutation rates facilitate the generation of viral escape mutants, rendering vaccines and drugs directed against virus-encoded targets potentially ineffective. In contrast, targeting host cell determinants temporarily dispensable for the host but crucial for virus replication could prevent viral escape. Here we report the discovery of 287 human host cell genes influencing influenza A virus replication in a genome-wide {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) screen. Using an independent assay we confirmed 168 hits (59\%) inhibiting either the endemic {H1N1} (119 hits) or the current pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A virus strains, with an overlap of 60\%. Notably, a subset of these common hits was also essential for replication of a highly pathogenic avian {H5N1} strain. In-depth analyses of several factors provided insights into their infection stage relevance. Notably, {SON} {DNA} binding protein ({SON}) was found to be important for normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in infection. We also show that a small molecule inhibitor of {CDC}-like kinase 1 ({CLK1}) reduces influenza virus replication by more than two orders of magnitude, an effect connected with impaired splicing of the viral M2 messenger {RNA}. Furthermore, influenza-virus-infected p27(-/-) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor {1B}; Cdkn1b) mice accumulated significantly lower viral titres in the lung, providing in vivo evidence for the importance of this gene. Thus, our results highlight the potency of genome-wide {RNAi} screening for the dissection of virus-host interactions and the identification of drug targets for a broad range of influenza viruses.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed ({DE}) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of {DE} genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. {RESULTS}: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis ({SPIA}) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that {SPIA} has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. {AVAILABILITY}: {SPIA} was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/}

abstract = {A novel human coronavirus, {SARS}-{CoV}, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide. Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of {SARS}-{CoV} in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted {SARS}-{CoV} ({rMA15}) that was lethal in {BALB}/c mice. In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old {C57BL}/6 mice with {rMA15} results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection. Here, we report that mice deficient in {MyD88} ({MyD88}(-/-)), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor ({TLR}), {IL}-{1R}, and {IL}-{18R} signaling, are far more susceptible to {rMA15} infection. The genetic absence of {MyD88} resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90\% mortality by day 6 post-infection. {MyD88}(-/-) mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection. Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in {MyD88}(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to {rMA15}-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in {MyD88}(-/-)mice. These data suggest that {MyD88}-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal {rMA15} infection.}

Using {SARS}-{CoV} as a model, we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo, and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models.

Here, we investigate mathematical modeling of influenza infection spread at a different scale; namely that occurring within an individual host or a cell culture. We review the models that have been developed in the last decades and discuss their contributions to our understanding of the dynamics of influenza infections. We review kinetic parameters (e.g., viral clearance rate, lifespan of infected cells) and values obtained through fitting mathematical models, and contrast them with values obtained directly from experiments. We explore the symbiotic role of mathematical models and experimental assays in improving our quantitative understanding of influenza infection dynamics. We also discuss the challenges in developing better, more comprehensive models for the course of influenza infections within a host or cell culture. Finally, we explain the contributions of such modeling efforts to important public health issues, and suggest future modeling studies that can help to address additional questions relevant to public health.}

To characterize the gene expression variation that underlies distinct infection outcomes and monitor infection phenotypes, we developed an experimental system that combines single-cell {RNA}-seq with fluorescent markers. Probing the responses of individual macrophages to invading Salmonella, we find that variation between individual infected host cells is determined by the heterogeneous activity of bacterial factors in individual infecting bacteria. We illustrate how variable {PhoPQ} activity in the population of invading bacteria drives variable host type I {IFN} responses by modifying {LPS} in a subset of bacteria. This work demonstrates a causative link between host and bacterial variability, with cell-to-cell variation between different bacteria being sufficient to drive radically different host immune responses.

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) is a zoonotic disease caused by {SARS}-related coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) that emerged in 2002 to become a global health concern. Although the original outbreak was controlled by classical public health measures, there is a real risk that another {SARS}-{CoV} could re-emerge from its natural reservoir, either in its original form or as a more virulent or pathogenic strain; in which case, the virus would be difficult to control in the absence of any effective antiviral drugs or vaccines. Using the well-studied {SARS}-{CoV} isolate {HKU}-39849, we developed a vaccinia virus-based {SARS}-{CoV} reverse genetic system that is both robust and biosafe. The {SARS}-{CoV} genome was cloned in separate vaccinia virus vectors, ({vSARS}-{CoV}-5prime and {vSARS}-{CoV}-3prime) as two {cDNAs} that were subsequently ligated to create a genome-length {SARS}-{CoV} {cDNA} template for in vitro transcription of {SARS}-{CoV} infectious {RNA} transcripts. Transfection of the {RNA} transcripts into permissive cells led to the recovery of infectious virus ({recSARS}-{CoV}). Characterization of the plaques produced by {recSARS}-{CoV} showed that they were similar in size to the parental {SARS}-{CoV} isolate {HKU}-39849 but smaller than the {SARS}-{CoV} isolate Frankfurt-1. Comparative analysis of replication kinetics showed that the kinetics of {recSARS}-{CoV} replication are similar to those of {SARS}-{CoV} Frankfurt-1, although the titers of virus released into the culture supernatant are approximately 10-fold less. The reverse genetic system was finally used to generate a {recSARS}-{CoV} reporter virus expressing Renilla luciferase in order to facilitate the analysis of {SARS}-{CoV} gene expression in human dendritic cells ({hDCs}). In parallel, a Renilla luciferase gene was also inserted into the genome of human coronavirus {229E} ({HCoV}-{229E}). Using this approach, we demonstrate that, in contrast to {HCoV}-{229E}, {SARS}-{CoV} is not able to mediate efficient heterologous gene expression in {hDCs}.}

This implies engagement of cellular signaling receptors during viral entry. Here, we present first indications for an interplay of {IAV} with receptor tyrosine kinases ({RTKs}). As representative {RTK} family-members the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and the c-Met receptor were studied. Modulation of expression or activity of both {RTKs} resulted in altered uptake of {IAV}, showing that these receptors transmit entry relevant signals upon virus binding.

Recent approaches have attempted to combine gene expression data with prior knowledge of protein connectivity in the form of a {PPI} network, and employ computational methods to identify subsets of the protein-protein-interaction ({PPI}) network that are functional, based on the data at hand. However, the use of undirected networks limits the mechanistic insight that can be drawn, since it does not allow for following mechanistically signal transduction from one node to the next. To address this important issue, we used a directed, signaling network as a scaffold to represent protein connectivity, and implemented an Integer Linear Programming ({ILP}) formulation to model the rules of signal transduction from one node to the next in the network. We then optimized the structure of the network to best fit the gene expression data at hand. We illustrated the utility of {ILP} modeling with a case study of drug induced lung injury. We identified the modes of action of 200 lung toxic drugs based on their gene expression profiles and, subsequently, merged the drug specific pathways to construct a signaling network that captured the mechanisms underlying Drug Induced Lung Disease ({DILD}). We further demonstrated the predictive power and biological relevance of the {DILD} network by applying it to identify drugs with relevant pharmacological mechanisms for treating lung injury.}

To improve network reconstruction we developed {MT}-{SDREM}, a multi-task learning method which jointly models networks for several related conditions. In {MT}-{SDREM}, parameters are jointly constrained across the networks while still allowing for condition-specific pathways and regulation. We formulate the multi-task learning problem and discuss methods for optimizing the joint target function. We applied {MT}-{SDREM} to reconstruct dynamic human response networks for three flu strains: {H1N1}, {H5N1} and {H3N2}. Our multi-task learning method was able to identify known and novel factors and genes, improving upon prior methods that model each condition independently.

It is considered a prerequisite for well-posed estimation, since it concerns the possibility of recovering uniquely the unknown model parameters from measured input-output data, under ideal conditions (noise-free observations and error-free model structure). Of course, determining if the parameters can be uniquely recovered from observed data is essential before investing resources, time and effort in performing actual biomedical experiments. Many interesting biological models are nonlinear but identifiability analysis for nonlinear system turns out to be a difficult mathematical problem. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to test identifiability of nonlinear models but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no software tools have been proposed for automatically checking identifiability of nonlinear models. In this paper, we describe a software tool implementing a differential algebra algorithm to perform parameter identifiability analysis for (linear and) nonlinear dynamic models described by polynomial or rational equations. Our goal is to provide the biological investigator a completely automatized software, requiring minimum prior knowledge of mathematical modelling and no in-depth understanding of the mathematical tools. The {DAISY} (Differential Algebra for Identifiability of {SYstems}) software will potentially be useful in biological modelling studies, especially in physiology and clinical medicine, where research experiments are particularly expensive and/or difficult to perform.

Furthermore, as the amount of biological knowledge increases, it becomes more and more difficult to integrate this large body of knowledge in a meaningful manner. In this article, we propose a particular solution to both of these challenges. {METHODS}: We integrate available biological knowledge by constructing a network of molecular interactions of a specific kind: causal interactions. The resulting causal graph can be queried to suggest molecular hypotheses that explain the variations observed in a high-throughput gene expression experiment. We show that a simple scoring function can discriminate between a large number of competing molecular hypotheses about the upstream cause of the changes observed in a gene expression profile. We then develop an analytical method for computing the statistical significance of each score. This analytical method also helps assess the effects of random or adversarial noise on the predictive power of our model. {RESULTS}: Our results show that the causal graph we constructed from known biological literature is extremely robust to random noise and to missing or spurious information. We demonstrate the power of our causal reasoning model on two specific examples, one from a cancer dataset and the other from a cardiac hypertrophy experiment. We conclude that causal reasoning models provide a valuable addition to the biologist's toolkit for the interpretation of gene expression data. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: R source code for the method is available upon request.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Causal graphs are an increasingly popular tool for the analysis of biological datasets. In particular, signed causal graphs--directed graphs whose edges additionally have a sign denoting upregulation or downregulation--can be used to model regulatory networks within a cell. Such models allow prediction of downstream effects of regulation of biological entities; conversely, they also enable inference of causative agents behind observed expression changes. However, due to their complex nature, signed causal graph models present special challenges with respect to assessing statistical significance. In this paper we frame and solve two fundamental computational problems that arise in practice when computing appropriate null distributions for hypothesis testing. {RESULTS}: First, we show how to compute a p-value for agreement between observed and model-predicted classifications of gene transcripts as upregulated, downregulated, or neither. Specifically, how likely are the classifications to agree to the same extent under the null distribution of the observed classification being randomized? This problem, which we call "Ternary Dot Product Distribution" owing to its mathematical form, can be viewed as a generalization of Fisher's exact test to ternary variables. We present two computationally efficient algorithms for computing the Ternary Dot Product Distribution and investigate its combinatorial structure analytically and numerically to establish computational complexity bounds.Second, we develop an algorithm for efficiently performing random sampling of causal graphs. This enables p-value computation under a different, equally important null distribution obtained by randomizing the graph topology but keeping fixed its basic structure: connectedness and the positive and negative in- and out-degrees of each vertex. We provide an algorithm for sampling a graph from this distribution uniformly at random. We also highlight theoretical challenges unique to signed causal graphs; previous work on graph randomization has studied undirected graphs and directed but unsigned graphs. {CONCLUSION}: We present algorithmic solutions to two statistical significance questions necessary to apply the causal graph methodology, a powerful tool for biological network analysis. The algorithms we present are both fast and provably correct. Our work may be of independent interest in non-biological contexts as well, as it generalizes mathematical results that have been studied extensively in other fields.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The abundance of many transcripts changes significantly in response to a variety of molecular and environmental perturbations. A key question in this setting is as follows: what intermediate molecular perturbations gave rise to the observed transcriptional changes? Regulatory programs are not exclusively governed by transcriptional changes but also by protein abundance and post-translational modifications making direct causal inference from data difficult. However, biomedical research over the last decades has uncovered a plethora of causal signaling cascades that can be used to identify good candidates explaining a specific set of transcriptional changes. {METHODS}: We take a Bayesian approach to integrate gene expression profiling with a causal graph of molecular interactions constructed from prior biological knowledge. In addition, we define the biological context of a specific interaction by the corresponding Medical Subject Headings terms. The Bayesian network can be queried to suggest upstream regulators that can be causally linked to the altered expression profile. {RESULTS}: Our approach will treat candidate regulators in the right biological context preferentially, enables hierarchical exploration of resulting hypotheses and takes the complete network of causal relationships into account to arrive at the best set of upstream regulators. We demonstrate the power of our method on distinct biological datasets, namely response to dexamethasone treatment, stem cell differentiation and a neuropathic pain model.

Here we described an {IL}-{17A}-triggered positive-feedback loop of {IL}-6 signaling, which involved the activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor ({NF})-{kappaB} and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ({STAT3}) in fibroblasts. Importantly, enhancement of this loop caused by disruption of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 ({SOCS3})-dependent negative regulation of the {IL}-6 signal transducer gp130 contributed to the development of arthritis. Because this mechanism also enhanced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ({EAE}) in wild-type mice, it may be a general etiologic process underlying other Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.}

In this study, we report the engagement of host phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase \gamma1 ({PLC}-\gamma1) in mediating cell entry of influenza virus {H1N1} but not {H3N2} subtype. Both {PLC}-\gamma1-specific inhibitor and short hairpin {RNA} ({shRNA}) strongly suppress the replication of {H1N1} but not {H3N2} viruses in cell culture, suggesting that {PLC}-\gamma1 plays an important subtype-specific role in the influenza viral life cycle. Further analyses demonstrate that {PLC}-\gamma1 activation is required for viral postbinding cell entry. In addition, {H1N1}, but not {H3N2}, infection leads to the phosphorylation of {PLC}-\gamma1 at Ser 1248 immediately after infection and independent of viral replication. We have further shown that {H1N1}-induced {PLC}-\gamma1 activation is downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) signaling. Interestingly, both {H1N1} and {H3N2} infections activate {EGFR}, but only {H1N1} infection leads to {PLC}-\gamma1 activation. Taking our findings together, we have identified for the first time the subtype-specific interplay of host {PLC}-\gamma1 signaling and {H1N1} virus that is critical for viral uptake early in the infection. Our study provides novel insights into how virus interacts with the cellular signaling network by demonstrating that viral determinants can regulate how the host signaling pathways function in virally infected cells.}

For instance, conservation of the transcriptional response to sepsis in mouse models and human disease remains controversial. To improve transcriptional analysis in immunology, we created {ImmuneSigDB}: a manually annotated compendium of ∼5,000 gene-sets from diverse cell states, experimental manipulations, and genetic perturbations in immunology. Analysis using {ImmuneSigDB} identified signatures induced in activated myeloid cells and differentiating lymphocytes that were highly conserved between humans and mice. Sepsis triggered conserved patterns of gene expression in humans and mouse models. However, we also identified species-specific biological processes in the sepsis transcriptional response: although both species upregulated phagocytosis-related genes, a mitosis signature was specific to humans. {ImmuneSigDB} enables granular analysis of transcriptomic data to improve biological understanding of immune processes of the human and mouse immune systems.

At present, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of {ARDS}. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) and {ACE2} are homologues with different key functions in the renin-angiotensin system. {ACE} cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin {II}, whereas {ACE2} inactivates angiotensin {II} and is a negative regulator of the system. {ACE2} has also recently been identified as a potential {SARS} virus receptor and is expressed in lungs. Here we report that {ACE2} and the angiotensin {II} type 2 receptor ({AT2}) protect mice from severe acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis. However, other components of the renin-angiotensin system, including {ACE}, angiotensin {II} and the angiotensin {II} type 1a receptor ({AT1a}), promote disease pathogenesis, induce lung oedemas and impair lung function. We show that mice deficient for Ace show markedly improved disease, and also that recombinant {ACE2} can protect mice from severe acute lung injury.

However, the development of vaccines against global pandemics such as {HIV}, malaria and tuberculosis has been obstructed by several challenges. A major challenge is the lack of knowledge about the correlates and mechanisms of protective immunity. Recent advances in the application of systems biological approaches to analyse immune responses to vaccination in humans are beginning to yield new insights about mechanisms of vaccine immunity, and to define molecular signatures, induced rapidly after vaccination, that correlate with and predict vaccine induced immunity. Here, we review these advances and discuss the potential of this systems vaccinology approach in defining novel correlates of protection in clinical trials, and in infection-induced 'experimental challenge models' in humans. \copyright 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Although these approaches have had some success, genetic variants are often only present in a small subset of the population, and screens are noisy with low overlap between experiments in different labs. Neither provides a mechanistic model explaining how identified genes impact the disease of interest or the dynamics of the pathways those genes regulate. Such mechanistic models could be used to accurately predict downstream effects of knocking down pathway members and allow comprehensive exploration of the effects of targeting pairs or higher-order combinations of genes. {RESULTS}: We developed methods to model the activation of signaling and dynamic regulatory networks involved in disease progression. Our model, {SDREM}, integrates static and time series data to link proteins and the pathways they regulate in these networks. {SDREM} uses prior information about proteins' likelihood of involvement in a disease (e.g. from screens) to improve the quality of the predicted signaling pathways. We used our algorithms to study the human immune response to {H1N1} influenza infection. The resulting networks correctly identified many of the known pathways and transcriptional regulators of this disease. Furthermore, they accurately predict {RNA} interference effects and can be used to infer genetic interactions, greatly improving over other methods suggested for this task. Applying our method to the more pathogenic {H5N1} influenza allowed us to identify several strain-specific targets of this infection. {AVAILABILITY}: {SDREM} is available from http://sb.cs.cmu.edu/sdrem. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {Dysregulation in signal transduction pathways can lead to a variety of complex disorders, including cancer. Computational approaches such as network analysis are important tools to understand system dynamics as well as to identify critical components that could be further explored as therapeutic targets. Here, we performed perturbation analysis of a large-scale signal transduction model in extracellular environments that stimulate cell death, growth, motility, and quiescence. Each of the model's components was perturbed under both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. Using 1,300 simulations under both types of perturbations across various extracellular conditions, we identified the most and least influential components based on the magnitude of their influence on the rest of the system. Based on the premise that the most influential components might serve as better drug targets, we characterized them for biological functions, housekeeping genes, essential genes, and druggable proteins. The most influential components under all environmental conditions were enriched with several biological processes. The inositol pathway was found as most influential under inactivating perturbations, whereas the kinase and small lung cancer pathways were identified as the most influential under activating perturbations. The most influential components were enriched with essential genes and druggable proteins. Moreover, known cancer drug targets were also classified in influential components based on the affected components in the network. Additionally, the systemic perturbation analysis of the model revealed a network motif of most influential components which affect each other. Furthermore, our analysis predicted novel combinations of cancer drug targets with various effects on other most influential components. We found that the combinatorial perturbation consisting of {PI3K} inactivation and overactivation of {IP3R1} can lead to increased activity levels of apoptosis-related components and tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that this combinatorial perturbation may lead to a better target for decreasing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Finally, our approach shows a potential to identify and prioritize therapeutic targets through systemic perturbation analysis of large-scale computational models of signal transduction. Although some components of the presented computational results have been validated against independent gene expression data sets, more laboratory experiments are warranted to more comprehensively validate the presented results.}

abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cellular homeostatic processes. Following ligand binding, {EGFR} activates different downstream signalling cascades that promote cell survival, proliferation, motility, and angiogenesis and induces F-actin-dependent {EGFR} endocytosis, which relocalises the activated receptors for degradation or recycling. The responses that are induced by ligand binding to {EGFR}, including cell signalling activation, protein kinase phosphorylation and cytoskeletal network rearrangement, resemble those induced by virus infection. Increasing evidence demonstrates that many viruses usurp {EGFR} endocytosis or {EGFR}-mediated signalling for entry, replication, inflammation, and viral antagonism to the host antiviral system. In addition, viruses have acquired sophisticated mechanisms to regulate {EGFR} functions by interrupting the {EGFR}-recycling process and modulating {EGFR} expression. In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanisms by which viruses alter {EGFR} signalling in favour of their continued survival. Copyright \copyright 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

abstract = {Airway epithelial cells are the primary cell type involved in respiratory viral infection. Upon infection, airway epithelium plays a critical role in host defense against viral infection by contributing to innate and adaptive immune responses. Influenza A virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus ({RSV}) represent a broad range of human viral pathogens that cause viral pneumonia and induce exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These respiratory viruses induce airway epithelial production of {IL}-8, which involves epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) activation. {EGFR} activation involves an integrated signaling pathway that includes {NADPH} oxidase activation of metalloproteinase, and {EGFR} proligand release that activates {EGFR}. Because respiratory viruses have been shown to activate {EGFR} via this signaling pathway in airway epithelium, we investigated the effect of virus-induced {EGFR} activation on airway epithelial antiviral responses. {CXCL10}, a chemokine produced by airway epithelial cells in response to respiratory viral infection, contributes to the recruitment of lymphocytes to target and kill virus-infected cells. While respiratory viruses activate {EGFR}, the interaction between {CXCL10} and {EGFR} signaling pathways is unclear, and the potential for {EGFR} signaling to suppress {CXCL10} has not been explored. Here, we report that respiratory virus-induced {EGFR} activation suppresses {CXCL10} production. We found that influenza virus-, rhinovirus-, and {RSV}-induced {EGFR} activation suppressed {IFN} regulatory factor ({IRF}) 1-dependent {CXCL10} production. In addition, inhibition of {EGFR} during viral infection augmented {IRF1} and {CXCL10}. These findings describe a novel mechanism that viruses use to suppress endogenous antiviral defenses, and provide potential targets for future therapies.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High-throughput measurement technologies produce data sets that have the potential to elucidate the biological impact of disease, drug treatment, and environmental agents on humans. The scientific community faces an ongoing challenge in the analysis of these rich data sources to more accurately characterize biological processes that have been perturbed at the mechanistic level. Here, a new approach is built on previous methodologies in which high-throughput data was interpreted using prior biological knowledge of cause and effect relationships. These relationships are structured into network models that describe specific biological processes, such as inflammatory signaling or cell cycle progression. This enables quantitative assessment of network perturbation in response to a given stimulus. {RESULTS}: Four complementary methods were devised to quantify treatment-induced activity changes in processes described by network models. In addition, companion statistics were developed to qualify significance and specificity of the results. This approach is called Network Perturbation Amplitude ({NPA}) scoring because the amplitudes of treatment-induced perturbations are computed for biological network models. The {NPA} methods were tested on two transcriptomic data sets: normal human bronchial epithelial ({NHBE}) cells treated with the pro-inflammatory signaling mediator {TNF\alpha}, and {HCT116} colon cancer cells treated with the {CDK} cell cycle inhibitor R547. Each data set was scored against network models representing different aspects of inflammatory signaling and cell cycle progression, and these scores were compared with independent measures of pathway activity in {NHBE} cells to verify the approach. The {NPA} scoring method successfully quantified the amplitude of {TNF\alpha}-induced perturbation for each network model when compared against {NF}-{\kappaB} nuclear localization and cell number. In addition, the degree and specificity to which {CDK}-inhibition affected cell cycle and inflammatory signaling were meaningfully determined. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {NPA} scoring method leverages high-throughput measurements and a priori literature-derived knowledge in the form of network models to characterize the activity change for a broad collection of biological processes at high-resolution. Applications of this framework include comparative assessment of the biological impact caused by environmental factors, toxic substances, or drug treatments.}

abstract = {The differences between individual cells can have profound functional consequences, in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Recently developed single-cell {mRNA}-sequencing methods enable unbiased, high-throughput, and high-resolution transcriptomic analysis of individual cells. This provides an additional dimension to transcriptomic information relative to traditional methods that profile bulk populations of cells. Already, single-cell {RNA}-sequencing methods have revealed new biology in terms of the composition of tissues, the dynamics of transcription, and the regulatory relationships between genes. Rapid technological developments at the level of cell capture, phenotyping, molecular biology, and bioinformatics promise an exciting future with numerous biological and medical applications.

The profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the virus is critical to the development of vaccine and diagnostic tools. In this study, 13 recombinant proteins associated with four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) and five putative uncharacterized proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a and 9b) of the {SARS}-{CoV} were prepared and used for screening and monitoring their specific {IgG} antibodies in {SARS} patient sera by protein microarray. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent-phase {SARS} patients, whereas those to proteins E, M, 3b, 6 and 7a were undetected. In the detectable specific antibodies, anti-S and anti-N were dominant and could persist in the sera of {SARS} patients until week 30. Among the rabbit antisera to recombinant proteins S3, N, 3a and 9b, only anti-S3 serum showed significant neutralizing activity to the {SARS}-{CoV} infection in Vero E6 cells. The results suggest (1) that anti-S and anti-N antibodies are diagnostic markers and in particular that S3 is immunogenic and therefore is a good candidate as a subunit vaccine antigen; and (2) that, from a virus structure viewpoint, the presence in some human sera of antibodies reacting with two recombinant polypeptides, 3a and 9b, supports the hypothesis that they are synthesized during the virus cycle.}

abstract = {The investigation of the dynamics and regulation of virus-triggered innate immune signaling pathways at a system level will enable comprehensive analysis of the complex interactions that maintain the delicate balance between resistance to infection and viral disease. In this study, we developed a delayed mathematical model to describe the virus-induced interferon ({IFN}) signaling process by considering several key players in the innate immune response. Using dynamic analysis and numerical simulation, we evaluated the following predictions regarding the antiviral responses: (1) When the replication ratio of virus is less than 1, the infectious virus will be eliminated by the immune system's defenses regardless of how the time delays are changed. (2) The {IFN} positive feedback regulation enhances the stability of the innate immune response and causes the immune system to present the bistability phenomenon. (3) The appropriate duration of viral replication and {IFN} feedback processes stabilizes the innate immune response. The predictions from the model were confirmed by monitoring the virus titer and {IFN} expression in infected cells. The results suggest that the balance between viral replication and {IFN}-induced feedback regulation coordinates the dynamical behavior of virus-triggered signaling and antiviral responses. This work will help clarify the mechanisms of the virus-induced innate immune response at a system level and provide instruction for further biological experiments.}

abstract = {It is commonly thought that autoimmune diseases are caused by the breakdown of self-tolerance, which suggests the recognition of specific antigens by autoreactive {CD4}+ T cells contribute to the specificity of autoimmune diseases (Marrack et al., 2001; Mathis and Benoist, 2004). In several cases, however, even for diseases associated with class {II} major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) alleles, the causative tissue-specific antigens recognized by memory/activated {CD4}+ T cells have not been established (Mocci et al., 2000; Skapenko et al., 2005). Rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}) and arthritis in F759 knock-in mice (F759 mice) are such examples (Atsumi et al., 2002; Brennan et al., 2002; Falgarone et al., 2009). These include associations with class {II} {MHC} and {CD4} molecules; increased numbers of memory/activated {CD4}+ T cells; and improved outcomes in response to suppressions and/or deficiencies in class {II} {MHC} molecules, {CD4}+ T cells, and the T cell survival cytokine {IL}-7. Regarding the development of arthritis in F759 mice, it is not only the immune system, but also non-immune tissue that are involved, indicating that the importance of their interactions (Sawa et al., 2006, 2009; Ogura et al., 2008; Hirano, 2010; Murakami et al., 2011). Furthermore, we have shown that local events such as microbleeding together with an accumulation of activated {CD4}+ T cells in a manner independent of tissue antigen-recognitions induces arthritis in the joints of F759 mice (Murakami et al., 2011). For example, local microbleeding-mediated {CCL20} expression induce such an accumulation, causing arthritis development via chronic activation of an {IL}-{17A}-dependent {IL}-6 signaling amplification loop in type 1 collagen+ cells that is triggered by {CD4}+ T cell-derived cytokine(s) such as {IL}-{17A}, which leads to the synergistic activation of {STAT3} and {NF\kappaB} in non-hematopoietic cells in the joint (Murakami et al., 2011). We named this loop the {IL}-6-mediated inflammation amplifier, or {IL}-6 amplifier for short (Ogura et al., 2008; Hirano, 2010; Murakami et al., 2011). Thus, certain class {II} {MHC}-associated, tissue-specific autoimmune diseases, including some {RA} subtypes, may be induced by local events that cause an antigen-independent accumulation of effector {CD4}+ T cells followed by the induction of the {IL}-6 amplifier in the affected tissue. In other words, in certain cases, the target tissue itself may determine the specificity of the autoimmune disease via activation of the {IL}-6 amplifier. To explain this hypothesis, we have proposed a four-step model for {MHC} class {II}-associated autoimmune diseases (Murakami et al., 2011): (1) T cell activation regardless of antigen specificity; (2) local events inducing a tissue-specific accumulation of activated T cells; (3) transient activation of the {IL}-6 amplifier; and (4) enhanced sensitivity to cytokines in the target tissue. The interaction of these events results in chronic activation of the {IL}-6 amplifier and subsequent manifestation of autoimmune diseases. Thus, the {IL}-6 amplifier, which is chronically activated by these four events, is a critical regulator of chronic inflammations in tissue-specific {MHC} class {II}-associated autoimmune diseases.}

There is currently no approved therapeutic for highly pathogenic coronaviruses, even as {MERS}-{CoV} is spreading throughout the Middle East. We previously screened a library of {FDA}-approved drugs for inhibitors of coronavirus replication in which we identified Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitors, including the anticancer drug imatinib, as inhibitors of both {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} in vitro Here we show that the anti-{CoV} activity of imatinib occurs at the early stages of infection, after internalization and endosomal trafficking, by inhibiting fusion of the virions at the endosomal membrane. We specifically identified the imatinib target, Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (Abl2), as required for efficient {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} replication in vitro These data demonstrate that specific approved drugs can be characterized in vitro for their anticoronavirus activity and used to identify host proteins required for coronavirus replication. This type of study is an important step in the repurposing of approved drugs for treatment of emerging coronaviruses. {IMPORTANCE}: Both {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} are zoonotic infections, with bats as the primary source. The 2003 {SARS}-{CoV} outbreak began in Guangdong Province in China and spread to humans via civet cats and raccoon dogs in the wet markets before spreading to 37 countries. The virus caused 8,096 confirmed cases of {SARS} and 774 deaths (a case fatality rate of ∼10\%). The {MERS}-{CoV} outbreak began in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries. {MERS}-{CoV} is believed to have emerged from bats and passed into humans via camels. The ongoing outbreak of {MERS}-{CoV} has resulted in 1,791 cases of {MERS} and 640 deaths (a case fatality rate of 36\%). The emergence of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} provides evidence that coronaviruses are currently spreading from zoonotic sources and can be highly pathogenic, causing serious morbidity and mortality in humans. Treatment of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} infection is limited to providing supportive therapy consistent with any serious lung disease, as no specific drugs have been approved as therapeutics. Highly pathogenic coronaviruses are rare and appear to emerge and disappear within just a few years. Currently, {MERS}-{CoV} is still spreading, as new infections continue to be reported. The outbreaks of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} and the continuing diagnosis of new {MERS} cases highlight the need for finding therapeutics for these diseases and potential future coronavirus outbreaks. Screening {FDA}-approved drugs streamlines the pipeline for this process, as these drugs have already been tested for safety in humans. Copyright \copyright 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract = {Influenza A virus ({IAV}) infection represents a global threat causing seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. Additionally, secondary bacterial infections, caused mainly by Streptococcus pneumoniae, are one of the main complications and responsible for the enhanced morbidity and mortality associated with {IAV} infections. In spite of the significant advances in our knowledge of {IAV} infections, holistic comprehension of the interplay between {IAV} and the host immune response ({IR}) remains largely fragmented. During the last decade, mathematical modeling has been instrumental to explain and quantify {IAV} dynamics. In this paper, we review not only the state of the art of mathematical models of {IAV} infection but also the methodologies exploited for parameter estimation. We focus on the adaptive {IR} control of {IAV} infection and the possible mechanisms that could promote a secondary bacterial coinfection. To exemplify {IAV} dynamics and identifiability issues, a mathematical model to explain the interactions between adaptive {IR} and {IAV} infection is considered. Furthermore, in this paper we propose a roadmap for future influenza research. The development of a mathematical modeling framework with a secondary bacterial coinfection, immunosenescence, host genetic factors and responsiveness to vaccination will be pivotal to advance {IAV} infection understanding and treatment optimization.}

In this paper, we study the simplest target cell-limited models to investigate the within-host dynamics of influenza A virus infection in humans. Despite the biological simplicity of the models, we show how these can be used to understand the severity of the infection and the key attributes of possible immunotherapy and antiviral drugs for the treatment of infection at different times post infection. Through an analytic approach, we derive and estimate simple summary biological quantities that can provide novel insights into the infection dynamics and the definition of clinical endpoints. We focus on nine quantities, including the area under the viral load curve, peak viral load, the time to peak viral load and the level of cell death due to infection. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we fitted the models to data collected from 12 untreated volunteers who participated in two clinical studies that tested the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Based on the results, we also discuss various difficulties in deriving precise estimates of the parameters, even in the very simple models considered, when experimental data are limited to viral load measures and/or there is a limited number of viral load measurements post infection. \copyright 2016 The Authors.}

They are thought to be able to trap and eliminate microorganisms from the lung. Among the mucins secreted in the lung, {MUC5AC} is the most prominent factor secreted by surface epithelial cells. Although much is known about the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of {MUC5AC} by host factors such as cytokines or proteases, less is known about the pathways triggered by microorganisms and, specifically, by influenza A virus ({IAV}). We therefore set up experiments to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for the potential modulation of {MUC5AC} by {IAV}. Using epithelial cells, C57/Bl6 mice, and {IAV} strains, we measured {MUC5AC} expression at the {RNA} and protein levels, specificity protein 1 (Sp1) activation, and protease activity. Intermediate molecular partners were confirmed using pharmacological inhibitors, blocking antibodies, and small interfering (si){RNAs}. We showed in vitro and in vivo that {IAV} up-regulates epithelial cell-derived {MUC5AC} and Muc5ac expression in mice, both at transcriptional (through the induction of Sp1) and translational levels. In addition, we determined that this induction was dependent on a protease-epithelial growth factor receptor-extracellular regulated kinase-Sp1 signaling cascade, involving in particular the human airway trypsin. Our data point to {MUC5AC} as a potential modulatory mechanism by which the lung epithelia respond to {IAV} infection, and we dissect, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the molecular partners involved. Future experiments using {MUC5AC}-targeted strategies should help further unravel the pathophysiological consequences of {IAV}-induced {MUC5AC} expression for lung homeostasis.}

abstract = {Cell-cell signaling pervades all aspects of development, not just in vertebrates, but in all animals (metazoa). It is a typifying characteristic of the major multicellular life forms, animals, plants, and fungi, which diverged about 1.2 billion years ago from a common ancestor descended from a lineage of unicellular life forms. In metazoa, at least 17 kinds of signal transduction pathways operate, each distinguished by its transduction intermediates. Five kinds predominate in early embryonic development, namely, the Wnt, {TGF}-beta, Hedgehog, {RTK}, and Notch pathways. Five more are used in late development, and seven more in the functions of differentiated cells. The pathways must have evolved and become conserved in pre-Cambrian times before the divergence of basal members of most of the modern phyla. In metazoan development and physiology, the responses of cells to intercellular signals include cell proliferation, secretion, motility, and transcription. These responses tend to be conserved among metazoa and shared with unicellular eukaryotes and in some cases even with unicellular prokaryotes. Protein components of the responses date back 2 billion years to ancestral eukaryotes or 3 billion to ancestral prokaryotes. Each metazoan developmental process consists of a network of signals and responses, and many of these networks are conserved among metazoa, for example, by insects and mammals. The study of model organisms, even of nonvertebrate groups, is expected to continue to contribute greatly to the understanding of mammalian development and to offer opportunities to analyze the effects of toxicants on development, as well as opportunities to devise incisive assays for toxicants.

Due to its high morbidity and mortality and widespread occurrence, {SARS} has evolved as an important respiratory disease which may be encountered everywhere in the world. The virus was identified as the causative agent of {SARS} due to the efforts of a {WHO}-led laboratory network. The potential mutability of the {SARS}-{CoV} genome may lead to new {SARS} outbreaks and several regions of the viral genomes open reading frames have been identified which may contribute to the severe virulence of the virus. With regard to the pathogenesis of {SARS}, several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system may exist. Vaccination would offer the most attractive approach to prevent new epidemics of {SARS}, but the development of vaccines is difficult due to missing data on the role of immune system-virus interactions and the potential mutability of the virus.

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying Zika virus ({ZIKV})-related microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the derivation and characterization, including single-cell {RNA}-seq, of neocortical and spinal cord neuroepithelial stem ({NES}) cells to model early human neurodevelopment and {ZIKV}-related neuropathogenesis. By analyzing human {NES} cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and a {ZIKV}-infected micrencephalic brain, we show that {ZIKV} infects both neocortical and spinal {NES} cells as well as their fetal homolog, radial glial cells ({RGCs}), causing disrupted mitoses, supernumerary centrosomes, structural disorganization, and cell death. {ZIKV} infection of {NES} cells and {RGCs} causes centrosomal depletion and mitochondrial sequestration of phospho-{TBK1} during mitosis. We also found that nucleoside analogs inhibit {ZIKV} replication in {NES} cells, protecting them from {ZIKV}-induced {pTBK1} relocalization and cell death. We established a model system of human neural stem cells to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental defects associated with {ZIKV} infection and its potential treatment.

While confirming that {ACE} 2 expression is high in renal and cardiovascular tissues, the novel observation has been made that {ACE} 2 shows comparably high levels of expression in the gastrointestinal system, in particular in ileum, duodenum, jejunum, caecum and colon.

High-content and high-throughput analysis technologies, concomitantly with data-driven and mechanistic modeling, hold promise for the systematic interrogation of these complex pathways. However, connecting genetic variation and molecular mechanisms to individual phenotypes and health outcomes has proven elusive. Gaps remain in data, and disagreements persist about the value of mechanistic modeling for immunology. Here, we present the perspectives that emerged from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ({NIAID}) workshop 'Complex Systems Science, Modeling and Immunity' and subsequent discussions regarding the potential synergy of high-throughput data acquisition, data-driven modeling, and mechanistic modeling to define new mechanisms of immunological disease and to accelerate the translation of these insights into therapies.

abstract = {The proapoptotic {PB1}-F2 protein of influenza A viruses has been shown to contribute to pathogenesis in the mouse model. Expression of full-length {PB1}-F2 increases the pathogenesis of the influenza A virus, causing weight loss, slower viral clearance, and increased viral titers in the lungs. After comparing viruses from the Hong Kong 1997 {H5N1} outbreak, one amino acid change ({N66S}) was found in the {PB1}-F2 sequence at position 66 that correlated with pathogenicity. This same amino acid change ({N66S}) was also found in the {PB1}-F2 protein of the 1918 pandemic A/Brevig Mission/18 virus. Two isogenic recombinant chimeric viruses were created with an influenza A/{WSN}/33 virus background containing the {PB1} segment from the {HK}/156/97: {WH} and {WH} {N66S}. In mice infected with {WH} {N66S} virus there was increased pathogenicity as measured by weight loss and decreased survival, and a 100-fold increase in virus replication when compared to mice infected with the {WH} virus. The 1918 pandemic strain A/Brevig Mission/18 was reconstructed with a pathogenicity-reducing mutation in {PB1}-F2 ({S66N}). The resultant 1918 {S66N} virus was attenuated in mice having a 3-log lower 50\% lethal dose and caused less morbidity and mortality in mice than the wild-type virus. Viral lung titers were also decreased in 1918 {S66N}-infected mice compared with wild-type 1918 virus-infected mice. In addition, both viruses with an S at position 66 ({WH} {N66S} and wt 1918) induced elevated levels of cytokines in the lungs of infected mice. Together, these data show that a single amino acid substitution in {PB1}-F2 can result in increased viral pathogenicity and could be one of the factors contributing to the high lethality seen with the 1918 pandemic virus.}

Subsequent disease models have shown that it can also be stimulated by the simultaneous activation of {NF\kappaB} and {STAT3}, functions as a local chemokine inducer, and acts as a mechanism for local inflammation, particularly chronic ones like rheumatoid arthritis and a multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we have recently shown that hyper activation of the {IL}-6 amplifier via regional neural activation establishes a gateway for immune cells including autoreactive T cells to pass the blood-brain barrier at dorsal vessels in 5(th) lumbar cord. Here we review how the {IL}-6 amplifier is activated by neural activation and the physiological relevance of the gateway to the central nervous system. Accumulating evidences continues to suggest that the {IL}-6 amplifier offers a potential molecular mechanism for the relationship between neural activation and the development of inflammatory diseases, which could establish a new interdisciplinary field that fuses neurology and immunology.}

abstract = {Network reconstruction algorithms are increasingly being employed in biomedical and life sciences research to integrate large-scale, high-dimensional data informing on living systems. One particular class of probabilistic causal networks being applied to model the complexity and causal structure of biological data is Bayesian networks ({BNs}). {BNs} provide an elegant mathematical framework for not only inferring causal relationships among many different molecular and higher order phenotypes, but also for incorporating highly diverse priors that provide an efficient path for incorporating existing knowledge. While significant methodological developments have broadly enabled the application of {BNs} to generate and validate meaningful biological hypotheses, the reproducibility of {BNs} in this context has not been systematically explored. In this study, we aim to determine the criteria for generating reproducible {BNs} in the context of transcription-based regulatory networks. We utilize two unique tissues from independent datasets, whole blood from the {GTEx} Consortium and liver from the Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Network Engineering Team ({STARNET}) study. We evaluated the reproducibility of the {BNs} by creating networks on data subsampled at different levels from each cohort and comparing these networks to the {BNs} constructed using the complete data. To help validate our results, we used simulated networks at varying sample sizes. Our study indicates that reproducibility of {BNs} in biological research is an issue worthy of further consideration, especially in light of the many publications that now employ findings from such constructs without appropriate attention paid to reproducibility. We find that while edge-to-edge reproducibility is strongly dependent on sample size, identification of more highly connected key driver nodes in {BNs} can be carried out with high confidence across a range of sample sizes.}

Here we propose a novel method for inferring causality that is no longer constrained by the conditional dependency arguments that limit the ability of statistical causal inference methods to resolve causal relationships within sets of graphical models that are Markov equivalent. Our method utilizes Bayesian belief propagation to infer the responses of perturbation events on molecular traits given a hypothesized graph structure. A distance measure between the inferred response distribution and the observed data is defined to assess the 'fitness' of the hypothesized causal relationships. To test our algorithm, we infer causal relationships within equivalence classes of gene networks in which the form of the functional interactions that are possible are assumed to be nonlinear, given synthetic microarray and {RNA} sequencing data. We also apply our method to infer causality in real metabolic network with v-structure and feedback loop. We show that our method can recapitulate the causal structure and recover the feedback loop only from steady-state data which conventional method cannot.}

Reports of recent outbreaks of a {SARS}-like disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) have raised serious concerns of a possible reemergence of {SARS}-{CoV}, either by laboratory escape or the presence of a natural reservoir. Therefore, the development of effective and safe {SARS} vaccines is still needed. Based on our previous studies, we believe that the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) in the S1 subunit of the {SARS}-{CoV} spike (S) protein is the most important target for developing a {SARS} vaccine. In particular, {RBD} of S protein contains the critical neutralizing domain ({CND}), which is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against divergent {SARS}-{CoV} strains. Furthermore, a {RBD}-based subunit vaccine is expected to be safer than other vaccines that may induce Th2-type immunopathology. This review will discuss key advances in the development of {RBD}-based {SARS} vaccines and the possibility of using a similar strategy to develop vaccines against {MERS}-{CoV}.}

In contrast, it is largely unknown whether host cell proteases located in the secretory pathway of infected cells and/or on the surface of target cells can cleave {SARS} S. We along with others could previously show that the type {II} transmembrane protease {TMPR\SS2} activates the influenza virus hemagglutinin and the human metapneumovirus F protein by cleavage. Here, we assessed whether {SARS} S is proteolytically processed by {TMPR\SS2}. Western blot analysis revealed that {SARS} S was cleaved into several fragments upon coexpression of {TMPR\SS2} (cis-cleavage) and upon contact between {SARS} S-expressing cells and {TMPR\SS2}-positive cells (trans-cleavage). cis-cleavage resulted in release of {SARS} S fragments into the cellular supernatant and in inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization, most likely because {SARS} S fragments function as antibody decoys. trans-cleavage activated {SARS} S on effector cells for fusion with target cells and allowed efficient {SARS} S-driven viral entry into targets treated with a lysosomotropic agent or a cathepsin inhibitor. Finally, {ACE2}, the cellular receptor for {SARS}-{CoV}, and {TMPR\SS2} were found to be coexpressed by type {II} pneumocytes, which represent important viral target cells, suggesting that {SARS} S is cleaved by {TMPR\SS2} in the lung of {SARS}-{CoV}-infected individuals. In summary, we show that {TMPR\SS2} might promote viral spread and pathogenesis by diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and by activating {SARS} S for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion.}

A picture emerges of a child born with an immature, innate and adaptive immune system, which matures and acquires memory as he or she grows. It then goes into decline in old age. These changes are considered alongside the risks of different types of infection, autoimmune disease and malignancy. \copyright 2015 The Authors.}

abstract = {Mammalian host response to pathogenic infections is controlled by a complex regulatory network connecting regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and signaling proteins to target genes. An important challenge in infectious disease research is to understand molecular similarities and differences in mammalian host response to diverse sets of pathogens. Recently, systems biology studies have produced rich collections of omic profiles measuring host response to infectious agents such as influenza viruses at multiple levels. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network driving host response to multiple infectious agents, we integrated host transcriptomes and proteomes using a network-based approach. Our approach combines expression-based regulatory network inference, structured-sparsity based regression, and network information flow to infer putative physical regulatory programs for expression modules. We applied our approach to identify regulatory networks, modules and subnetworks that drive host response to multiple influenza infections. The inferred regulatory network and modules are significantly enriched for known pathways of immune response and implicate apoptosis, splicing, and interferon signaling processes in the differential response of viral infections of different pathogenicities. We used the learned network to prioritize regulators and study virus and time-point specific networks. {RNAi}-based knockdown of predicted regulators had significant impact on viral replication and include several previously unknown regulators. Taken together, our integrated analysis identified novel module level patterns that capture strain and pathogenicity-specific patterns of expression and helped identify important regulators of host response to influenza infection.}

abstract = {Innate immunity is a primordial system that has a primary role in lung antimicrobial defenses. Recent advances in understanding the recognition systems by which cells of the innate immune system recognize and respond to microbial products have revolutionized the understanding of host defenses in the lungs and other tissues. The innate immune system includes lung leukocytes and also epithelial cells lining the alveolar surface and the conducting airways. The innate immune system drives adaptive immunity in the lungs and has important interactions with other systems, including apoptosis pathways and signaling pathways induced by mechanical stretch. Human diversity in innate immune responses could explain some of the variability seen in the responses of patients to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in the lungs. New strategies to modify innate immune responses could be useful in limiting the adverse consequences of some inflammatory reactions in the lungs.}

When a pathogen meets its host, a series of intricate intracellular interactions shape the outcome of the infection. The understanding of these host-pathogen interactions is crucial for the development of treatments and preventive measures against infectious diseases. Over the past decade, proteomic approaches have become prime contributors to the discovery and understanding of host-pathogen interactions that represent anti- and pro-pathogenic cellular responses. Here, we review these proteomic methods and their application to studying viral and bacterial intracellular pathogens. We examine approaches for defining spatial and temporal host-pathogen protein interactions upon infection of a host cell. Further expanding the understanding of proteome organization during an infection, we discuss methods that characterize the regulation of host and pathogen proteomes through alterations in protein abundance, localization, and post-translational modifications. Finally, we highlight bioinformatic tools available for analyzing such proteomic datasets, as well as novel strategies for integrating proteomics with other omic tools, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, to obtain a systems-level understanding of infectious diseases. \copyright 2017 The Authors.

Viruses, as intracellular parasites, require from their cellular host the building blocks for generation of their viral progeny and the energy that drives viral replication and assembly. While some viruses have adopted ways to manipulate the infected cell such that cellular metabolism supports optimal virus production, other viruses simply exhaust cellular resources. The association of viruses with mitochondria is influenced by several important factors such as speed of the viral replication cycle and viral dependence on cellular enzymes and metabolites. This review will highlight the complex interconnectivity of viral life cycles with the three main mitochondrial metabolic pathways, namely \beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic ({TCA}) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. This interconnectivity has the potential to reveal interesting points for antiviral therapy with either prometabolites or antimetabolites and highlights the importance of the viral association with mitochondrial metabolism.}

abstract = {Jointly analyzing biological pathway maps and experimental data is critical for understanding how biological processes work in different conditions and why different samples exhibit certain characteristics. This joint analysis, however, poses a significant challenge for visualization. Current techniques are either well suited to visualize large amounts of pathway node attributes, or to represent the topology of the pathway well, but do not accomplish both at the same time. To address this we introduce {enRoute}, a technique that enables analysts to specify a path of interest in a pathway, extract this path into a separate, linked view, and show detailed experimental data associated with the nodes of this extracted path right next to it. This juxtaposition of the extracted path and the experimental data allows analysts to simultaneously investigate large amounts of potentially heterogeneous data, thereby solving the problem of joint analysis of topology and node attributes. As this approach does not modify the layout of pathway maps, it is compatible with arbitrary graph layouts, including those of hand-crafted, image-based pathway maps. We demonstrate the technique in context of pathways from the {KEGG} and the Wikipathways databases. We apply experimental data from two public databases, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ({CCLE}) and The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) that both contain a wide variety of genomic datasets for a large number of samples. In addition, we make use of a smaller dataset of hepatocellular carcinoma and common xenograft models. To verify the utility of {enRoute}, domain experts conducted two case studies where they explore data from the {CCLE} and the hepatocellular carcinoma datasets in the context of relevant pathways.}

abstract = {The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, which was unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected, highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus ({EBOV}) disease ({EVD}) or sequelae. No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule {GS}-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, with antiviral activity against {EBOV}. {GS}-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of {EBOV} and other filoviruses in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate ({NTP}) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with {GS}-5734 in vitro, and the {NTP} acts as an alternative substrate and {RNA}-chain terminator in primer-extension assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus {RNA} polymerase. Intravenous administration of {GS}-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent {NTP} levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life, 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of {EVD}, once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg(-1) {GS}-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of {EBOV} replication and protected 100\% of {EBOV}-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral {RNA} was detected in two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against {EBOV} in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of {GS}-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic {RNA} viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use. {GS}-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.}

The goal of this perspective is to provide suggestions for causal inference in large-scale experiments, which utilize high-throughput technologies such as mass-spectrometry-based proteomics.

abstract = {Models of within-host influenza viral dynamics have contributed to an improved understanding of viral dynamics and antiviral effects over the past decade. Existing models can be classified into two broad types based on the mechanism of viral control: models utilising target cell depletion to limit the progress of infection and models which rely on timely activation of innate and adaptive immune responses to control the infection. In this paper, we compare how two exemplar models based on these different mechanisms behave and investigate how the mechanistic difference affects the assessment and prediction of antiviral treatment. We find that the assumed mechanism for viral control strongly influences the predicted outcomes of treatment. Furthermore, we observe that for the target cell-limited model the assumed drug efficacy strongly influences the predicted treatment outcomes. The area under the viral load curve is identified as the most reliable predictor of drug efficacy, and is robust to model selection. Moreover, with support from previous clinical studies, we suggest that the target cell-limited model is more suitable for modelling in vitro assays or infection in some immunocompromised/immunosuppressed patients while the immune response model is preferred for predicting the infection/antiviral effect in immunocompetent animals/patients.}

abstract = {Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses ({CoVs}) have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome {CoV} ({SARS}-{CoV}) and Middle East respiratory syndrome {CoV} ({MERS}-{CoV}) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting {CoV} infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic {CoV} infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, {GS}-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar {IC50} values. {GS}-5734 was also effective against bat {CoVs}, prepandemic bat {CoVs}, and circulating contemporary human {CoV} in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-{CoV} activity. In a mouse model of {SARS}-{CoV} pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of {GS}-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that {GS}-5734 may prove effective against endemic {MERS}-{CoV} in the Middle East, circulating human {CoV}, and, possibly most importantly, emerging {CoV} of the future.

We make several unexpected observations masked by population-based experiments: (1) viral and cellular factors contribute uniquely and independently to viral infection kinetics; (2) cellular factors cause wide variation in replication start times; and (3) infections frequently begin later and replication occurs faster than predicted by population measurements. We show that mutational load impairs interaction of the viral population with the host, delaying replication start times and explaining the attenuated phenotype of a mutator virus. We show that an antiviral drug can selectively extinguish the most-fit members of the viral population.

In this article, control theory is discussed as an approach to dissect the control logic of complex pathways. One of the key issues is distinguishing between the terms control and regulation and how these concepts are applied to regulated enzymes such as phosphofructokinase.

abstract = {Early life is a period of particular susceptibility to respiratory infections and symptoms are frequently more severe in infants than in adults. The neonatal immune system is generally held to be deficient in most compartments; responses to innate stimuli are weak, antigen-presenting cells have poor immunostimulatory activity and adaptive lymphocyte responses are limited, leading to poor immune memory and ineffective vaccine responses. For mucosal surfaces such as the lung, which is continuously exposed to airborne antigen and to potential pathogenic invasion, the ability to discriminate between harmless and potentially dangerous antigens is essential, to prevent inflammation that could lead to loss of gaseous exchange and damage to the developing lung tissue. We have only recently begun to define the differences in respiratory immunity in early life and its environmental and developmental influences. The innate immune system may be of relatively greater importance than the adaptive immune system in the neonatal and infant period than later in life, as it does not require specific antigenic experience. A better understanding of what constitutes protective innate immunity in the respiratory tract in this age group and the factors that influence its development should allow us to predict why certain infants are vulnerable to severe respiratory infections, design treatments to accelerate the development of protective immunity, and design age specific adjuvants to better boost immunity to infection in the lung.}

In children, {RSV} is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections, and in adults {RSV} causes pneumonia and contributes to exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. {RSV} induces airway epithelial inflammation by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), a tyrosine kinase receptor. Recently, {EGFR} inhibition was shown to decrease {RSV} infection, but the mechanism(s) for this effect are not known. Interferon ({IFN}) signaling is critical for innate antiviral responses, and recent experiments have implicated {IFN}-\lambda (lambda), a type {III} {IFN}, as the most significant {IFN} for mucosal antiviral immune responses to {RSV} infection. However, a role for {RSV}-induced {EGFR} activation to suppress airway epithelial antiviral immunity has not been explored. Here, we show that {RSV}-induced {EGFR} activation suppresses {IFN} regulatory factor ({IRF}) 1-induced {IFN}-\lambda production and increased viral infection, and we implicate {RSV} F protein to mediate this effect. {EGFR} inhibition, during viral infection, augmented {IRF1}, {IFN}-\lambda, and decreased {RSV} titers.

Several different experimental models have been used as a proxy for human infection, including cell cultures derived from human cells, mice, and non-human primates. Each of these systems has been studied extensively in isolation, but little effort has been directed toward systematically characterizing the conservation of host response on a global level beyond known immune signaling cascades. {RESULTS}: In the present study, we employed a multivariate modeling approach to characterize and compare the transcriptional regulatory networks between these three model systems after infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the {H5N1} subtype. Using this approach we identified functions and pathways that display similar behavior and/or regulation including the well-studied impact on the interferon response and the inflammasome. Our results also suggest a primary response role for airway epithelial cells in initiating hypercytokinemia, which is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of {H5N1} viruses. We further demonstrate that we can use a transcriptional regulatory model from the human cell culture data to make highly accurate predictions about the behavior of important components of the innate immune system in tissues from whole organisms. {CONCLUSIONS}: This is the first demonstration of a global regulatory network modeling conserved host response between in vitro and in vivo models.}

abstract = {Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Rapid and efficient detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns via pattern-recognition receptors is essential for the host to mount defensive and protective responses. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I ({RIG}-I) is critical in triggering antiviral and inflammatory responses for the control of viral replication in response to cytoplasmic virus-specific {RNA} structures. Upon viral {RNA} recognition, {RIG}-I recruits the mitochondrial adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, which leads to a signaling cascade that coordinates the induction of type I interferons ({IFNs}), as well as a large variety of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. The {RIG}-I activation is tightly regulated via various posttranslational modifications for the prevention of aberrant innate immune signaling. By contrast, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, such as sequestrating viral structures from {RIG}-I detections and targeting receptor or signaling molecules for degradation. These virus-host interactions have broadened our understanding of viral pathogenesis and provided insights into the function of the {RIG}-I pathway. In this review, we summarize the recent advances regarding {RIG}-I pathogen recognition and signaling transduction, cell-intrinsic control of {RIG}-I activation, and the viral antagonism of {RIG}-I signaling.}

Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of {RAF}/{MEK}/{ERK} and {PI}-{3K}/{AKT} kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this {MCF10A} cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic {ERK} and {AKT} inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by {BIM} rather than {BAD}, which is supported by prior experimental studies. {AKT} dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between {EGF} and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic {ERK}, and not {AKT}, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest {MEK} alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to {AKT} inhibition.

Upon detection of {IAV} infection, host immune system aims to defend against and clear the viral infection. Innate immune system is comprised of physical barriers (mucus and collectins), various phagocytic cells, group of cytokines, interferons ({IFNs}), and {IFN}-stimulated genes, which provide first line of defense against {IAV} infection. The adaptive immunity is mediated by B cells and T cells, characterized with antigen-specific memory cells, capturing and neutralizing the pathogen. The humoral immune response functions through hemagglutinin-specific circulating antibodies to neutralize {IAV}. In addition, antibodies can bind to the surface of infected cells and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement activation. Although there are neutralizing antibodies against the virus, cellular immunity also plays a crucial role in the fight against {IAVs}. On the other hand, {IAVs} have developed multiple strategies to escape from host immune surveillance for successful replication. In this review, we discuss how immune system, especially innate immune system and critical molecules are involved in the antiviral defense against {IAVs}. In addition, we highlight how {IAVs} antagonize different immune responses to achieve a successful infection.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Biomedical named entity recognition (Bio-{NER}) is a challenging problem because, in general, biomedical named entities of the same category (e.g., proteins and genes) do not follow one standard nomenclature. They have many irregularities and sometimes appear in ambiguous contexts. In recent years, machine-learning ({ML}) approaches have become increasingly common and now represent the cutting edge of Bio-{NER} technology. This paper addresses three problems faced by {ML}-based Bio-{NER} systems. First, most {ML} approaches usually employ singleton features that comprise one linguistic property (e.g., the current word is capitalized) and at least one class tag (e.g., B-protein, the beginning of a protein name). However, such features may be insufficient in cases where multiple properties must be considered. Adding conjunction features that contain multiple properties can be beneficial, but it would be infeasible to include all conjunction features in an {NER} model since memory resources are limited and some features are ineffective. To resolve the problem, we use a sequential forward search algorithm to select an effective set of features. Second, variations in the numerical parts of biomedical terms (e.g., "2" in the biomedical term {IL2}) cause data sparseness and generate many redundant features. In this case, we apply numerical normalization, which solves the problem by replacing all numerals in a term with one representative numeral to help classify named entities. Third, the assignment of {NE} tags does not depend solely on the target word's closest neighbors, but may depend on words outside the context window (e.g., a context window of five consists of the current word plus two preceding and two subsequent words). We use global patterns generated by the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm to identify such structures and modify the results of our {ML}-based tagger. This is called pattern-based post-processing. {RESULTS}: To develop our {ML}-based Bio-{NER} system, we employ conditional random fields, which have performed effectively in several well-known tasks, as our underlying {ML} model. Adding selected conjunction features, applying numerical normalization, and employing pattern-based post-processing improve the F-scores by 1.67\%, 1.04\%, and 0.57\%, respectively. The combined increase of 3.28\% yields a total score of 72.98\%, which is better than the baseline system that only uses singleton features. {CONCLUSION}: We demonstrate the benefits of using the sequential forward search algorithm to select effective conjunction feature groups. In addition, we show that numerical normalization can effectively reduce the number of redundant and unseen features. Furthermore, the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm can help {ML}-based Bio-{NER} deal with difficult cases that need longer context windows.}

Here, we identified {ANXA2} as a {RNA} binding protein ({RBP}) that binds {IBV} (Infectious Bronchitis Virus) pseudoknot {RNA}. We first confirmed the binding of {ANXA2} to {IBV} pseudoknot {RNA} by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to {RNA} pseudoknot with {ANXA2} protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the {RNA} pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of {IBV} was used as bait for cellular {RBPs}, we tested whether {ANXA2} could regulate the frameshfting of {IBV} pseudoknot {RNA} by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of {ANXA2} significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from {IBV} pseudoknot {RNA} and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that {ANXA2} is a cellular {RBP} that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral {RNA}, enabling it to act as an anti-viral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in {RNA} metabolism for other cellular {mRNAs}.}

abstract = {Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 {PRF}) is a widely used translational mechanism facilitating the expression of two polypeptides from a single {mRNA}. Commonly, the ribosome interacts with an {mRNA} secondary structure that promotes -1 frameshifting on a homopolymeric slippery sequence. Recently, we described an unusual -2 frameshifting (-2 {PRF}) signal directing efficient expression of a transframe protein [nonstructural protein {2TF} ({nsp2TF})] of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ({PRRSV}) from an alternative reading frame overlapping the viral replicase gene. Unusually, this arterivirus {PRF} signal lacks an obvious stimulatory {RNA} secondary structure, but as confirmed here, can also direct the occurrence of -1 {PRF}, yielding a third, truncated nsp2 variant named "{nsp2N}." Remarkably, we now show that both -2 and -1 {PRF} are transactivated by a protein factor, specifically a {PRRSV} replicase subunit (nsp1\beta). Embedded in nsp1\beta's papain-like autoproteinase domain, we identified a highly conserved, putative {RNA}-binding motif that is critical for {PRF} transactivation. The minimal {RNA} sequence required for {PRF} was mapped within a 34-nt region that includes the slippery sequence and a downstream conserved {CCCANCUCC} motif. Interaction of nsp1\beta with the {PRF} signal was demonstrated in pull-down assays. These studies demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that a protein can function as a transactivator of ribosomal frameshifting. The newly identified frameshifting determinants provide potential antiviral targets for arterivirus disease control and prevention. Moreover, protein-induced transactivation of frameshifting may be a widely used mechanism, potentially including previously undiscovered viral strategies to regulate viral gene expression and/or modulate host cell translation upon infection.}

abstract = {Read counting and unique molecular identifier ({UMI}) counting are the principal gene expression quantification schemes used in single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) analysis. By using multiple {scRNA}-seq datasets, we reveal distinct distribution differences between these schemes and conclude that the negative binomial model is a good approximation for {UMI} counts, even in heterogeneous populations. We further propose a novel differential expression analysis algorithm based on a negative binomial model with independent dispersions in each group ({NBID}). Our results show that this properly controls the {FDR} and achieves better power for {UMI} counts when compared to other recently developed packages for {scRNA}-seq analysis.}

abstract = {We introduce the Dynamic Influence Network ({DIN}), a novel visual analytics technique for representing and analyzing rule-based models of protein-protein interaction networks. Rule-based modeling has proved instrumental in developing biological models that are concise, comprehensible, easily extensible, and that mitigate the combinatorial complexity of multi-state and multi-component biological molecules. Our technique visualizes the dynamics of these rules as they evolve over time. Using the data produced by {KaSim}, an open source stochastic simulator of rule-based models written in the Kappa language, {DINs} provide a node-link diagram that represents the influence that each rule has on the other rules. That is, rather than representing individual biological components or types, we instead represent the rules about them (as nodes) and the current influence of these rules (as links). Using our interactive {DIN}-Viz software tool, researchers are able to query this dynamic network to find meaningful patterns about biological processes, and to identify salient aspects of complex rule-based models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we investigate a simulation of a circadian clock model that illustrates the oscillatory behavior of the {KaiC} protein phosphorylation cycle.}

Yet, both the impact of intracellular viral replication and the variation in host response across different cell types remain uncharacterized. Here we used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity in the response of lung tissue cells to in vivo influenza infection. Analysis of viral and host transcriptomes in the same single cell enabled us to resolve the cellular heterogeneity of bystander (exposed but uninfected) as compared with infected cells. We reveal that all major immune and non-immune cell types manifest substantial fractions of infected cells, albeit at low viral transcriptome loads relative to epithelial cells. We show that all cell types respond primarily with a robust generic transcriptional response, and we demonstrate novel markers specific for influenza-infected as opposed to bystander cells.

However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis ({MOFA}), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. {MOFA} infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied {MOFA} to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, {RNA} expression, {DNA} methylation and ex vivo drug responses. {MOFA} identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used {MOFA} to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation. \copyright 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The advent of "omics" science has brought new perspectives in contemporary biology through the high-throughput analyses of molecular interactions, providing new clues in protein/gene function and in the organization of biological pathways. Biomolecular interaction networks, or graphs, are simple abstract representations where the components of a cell (e.g. proteins, metabolites etc.) are represented by nodes and their interactions are represented by edges. An appropriate visualization of data is crucial for understanding such networks, since pathways are related to functions that occur in specific regions of the cell. The force-directed layout is an important and widely used technique to draw networks according to their topologies. Placing the networks into cellular compartments helps to quickly identify where network elements are located and, more specifically, concentrated. Currently, only a few tools provide the capability of visually organizing networks by cellular compartments. Most of them cannot handle large and dense networks. Even for small networks with hundreds of nodes the available tools are not able to reposition the network while the user is interacting, limiting the visual exploration capability. {RESULTS}: Here we propose {CellNetVis}, a web tool to easily display biological networks in a cell diagram employing a constrained force-directed layout algorithm. The tool is freely available and open-source. It was originally designed for networks generated by the Integrated Interactome System and can be used with networks from others databases, like {InnateDB}. {CONCLUSIONS}: {CellNetVis} has demonstrated to be applicable for dynamic investigation of complex networks over a consistent representation of a cell on the Web, with capabilities not matched elsewhere.}

The main components of the platform are the Kappa Simulator, the Kappa Static Analyzer and the Kappa Story Extractor. In addition to these components, we describe the Kappa User Interface, which includes a range of interactive visualization tools for rule-based models needed to make sense of the complexity of biological systems. We argue that, in this approach, modeling is akin to programming and can likewise benefit from an integrated development environment. Our platform is a step in this direction. Results: We discuss details about the computation and rendering of static, dynamic, and causal views of a model, which include the contact map ({CM}), snaphots at different resolutions, the dynamic influence network ({DIN}) and causal compression. We provide use cases illustrating how these concepts generate insight. Specifically, we show how the {CM} and snapshots provide information about systems capable of polymerization, such as Wnt signaling. A well-understood model of the {KaiABC} oscillator, translated into Kappa from the literature, is deployed to demonstrate the {DIN} and its use in understanding systems dynamics. Finally, we discuss how pathways might be discovered or recovered from a rule-based model by means of causal compression, as exemplified for early events in {EGF} signaling.

Many viruses (e.g., Influenza virus, Rhinovirus [{RV}], Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Hepatitis C virus) activate epithelial epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), a tyrosine kinase receptor, but the role of {EGFR} in viral pathogenesis is not clear. Interferon ({IFN}) signaling is a critical innate antiviral host response and recent experiments have implicated {IFN}-\lambda, a type {III} {IFN}, as the most significant {IFN} for mucosal antiviral immune responses. Despite the importance of {IFN}-\lambda in epithelial antiviral responses, the role and mechanisms of epithelial {IFN}-\lambda signaling have not been fully elucidated. We report that respiratory virus-induced {EGFR} activation suppresses endogenous airway epithelial antiviral signaling. We found that Influenza virus- and {RV}-induced {EGFR} activation suppressed {IFN} regulatory factor ({IRF}) 1-induced {IFN}-\lambda production and increased viral infection. In addition, inhibition of {EGFR} during viral infection augmented {IRF1} and {IFN}-\lambda, which resulted in decreased viral titers in vitro and in vivo. These findings describe a novel mechanism that viruses use to suppress endogenous antiviral defenses, and provide potential targets for future therapies.}

Little information is available on the role of major traffic hubs, such as airports, in the transmission of respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza and a pandemic threat. We investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in the passenger environment of a major airport in order to identify risk points and guide measures to minimize transmission. {METHODS}: Surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza in 2015-16 in Finland. Swabs from surface samples, and air samples were tested by real-time {PCR} for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses ({229E}, {HKU1}, {NL63} and {OC43}). {RESULTS}: Nucleic acid of at least one respiratory virus was detected in 9 out of 90 (10\%) surface samples, including: a plastic toy dog in the children's playground (2/3 swabs, 67\%); hand-carried luggage trays at the security check area (4/8, 50\%); the buttons of the payment terminal at the pharmacy (1/2, 50\%); the handrails of stairs (1/7, 14\%); and the passenger side desk and divider glass at a passport control point (1/3, 33\%).

Of the surfaces tested, plastic security screening trays appeared to pose the highest potential risk, and handling these is almost inevitable for all embarking passengers.}

A group of such activating receptors is stochastically expressed by certain subsets within the {NK} cell compartment. After engagement of the cognate viral ligand, these receptors contribute to the specific activation and 'preferential' population expansion of defined {NK} cell subsets, which partially recapitulate some features of adaptive lymphocytes.

abstract = {The immune system has been traditionally divided into two arms called innate and adaptive immunity. Typically, innate immunity refers to rapid defense mechanisms that set in motion within minutes to hours following an insult. Conversely, the adaptive immune response emerges after several days and relies on the innate immune response for its initiation and subsequent outcome. However, the recent discovery of immune cells displaying merged properties indicates that this distinction is not mutually exclusive. These populations that span the innate-adaptive border of immunity comprise, among others, {CD1d}-restricted natural killer T cells and {MR1}-restricted mucosal-associated invariant T cells. These cells have the unique ability to swiftly activate in response to non-peptidic antigens through their T cell receptor and/or to activating cytokines in order to modulate many aspects of the immune response. Despite they recirculate all through the body via the bloodstream, these cells mainly establish residency at barrier sites including lungs. Here, we discuss the current knowledge into the biology of these cells during lung (viral and bacterial) infections including activation mechanisms and functions. We also discuss future strategies targeting these cell types to optimize immune responses against respiratory pathogens.}

To overcome the innate antiviral response, {RNA} viruses encode suppressors of {IFN}-\alpha/\beta induction, which block {RLRs} recognition of {dsRNA} by means of different mechanisms that can be categorized into: (i) {dsRNA} binding and/or shielding ("hide"), (ii) {dsRNA} termini processing ("mask") and (iii) direct interaction with components of the {RLRs} pathway ("hit").

This methodology requires prior knowledge in the form of small networks that causally link a key upstream controller node representing a biological mechanism to downstream measurable quantities. These small directed networks are generated from a knowledge base of literature-curated qualitative biological cause-and-effect relationships expressed as a network. The small mechanism networks are evaluated as hypotheses to explain observed differential measurements. We provide a simple implementation of this methodology, Whistle, specifically geared towards the analysis of gene expression data and using prior knowledge expressed in Biological Expression Language ({BEL}). We present the Whistle analyses for three transcriptomic data sets using a publically available knowledge base. The mechanisms inferred by Whistle are consistent with the expected biology for each data set. {CONCLUSIONS}: Reverse Causal Reasoning yields mechanistic insights to the interpretation of gene expression profiling data that are distinct from and complementary to the results of analyses using ontology or pathway gene sets.

Mathematical modeling and microscopy structural analysis show that infection triggers peroxisome growth and fission, leading to increased peroxisome numbers and irregular disc-like structures. {HCMV}-induced peroxisome biogenesis increased the phospholipid plasmalogen, thereby enhancing virus production. Peroxisome regulation and dependence were not observed for the non-enveloped adenovirus. Our findings uncover a role of peroxisomes in viral pathogenesis, with likely implications for multiple enveloped viruses. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Viruses hijack the host cell machinery and recruit host proteins to aid their replication. Several host proteins also play vital roles in inhibiting viral replication. Emerging class of host proteins central to both of these processes are the {DEAD}-box helicases: a highly conserved family of {ATP}-dependent {RNA} helicases, bearing a common D-E-A-D (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) motif. They play key roles in numerous cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, {miRNA} biogenesis and translation. Though their sequences are highly conserved, these helicases have quite diverse roles in the cell. Interestingly, often these helicases display contradictory actions in terms of the support and/or clearance of invading viruses. Increasing evidence highlights the importance of these enzymes, however, little is known about the structural basis of viral {RNA} recognition by the members of the {DEAD}-box family. This review summarizes the current knowledge in the field for selected {DEAD}-box helicases and highlights their diverse actions upon viral invasion of the host cell. We anticipate that through a better understanding of how these helicases are being utilized by viral {RNAs} and proteins to aid viral replication, it will be possible to address the urgent need to develop novel therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections.}

We fit this model using mixed fourth moments [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] of marginal effect sizes for each trait; if trait 1 is causal for trait 2, then {SNPs} affecting trait 1 (large [Formula: see text]) will have correlated effects on trait 2 (large \alpha1\alpha2), but not vice versa.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS})-{CoV} was identified as the etiologic agent of the 2002-2003 international {SARS} outbreak. Yet, how {SARS} evades innate immune responses to cause human disease remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that a protein encoded by {SARS}-{CoV} designated as open reading frame-9b ({ORF}-9b) localizes to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial elongation by triggering ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of dynamin-like protein 1, a host protein involved in mitochondrial fission. Also, acting on mitochondria, {ORF}-9b targets the mitochondrial-associated adaptor molecule {MAVS} signalosome by usurping {PCBP2} and the {HECT} domain E3 ligase {AIP4} to trigger the degradation of {MAVS}, {TRAF3}, and {TRAF} 6. This severely limits host cell {IFN} responses. Reducing either {PCBP2} or {AIP4} expression substantially reversed the {ORF}-9b-mediated reduction of {MAVS} and the suppression of antiviral transcriptional responses. Finally, transient {ORF}-9b expression led to a strong induction of autophagy in cells. The induction of autophagy depended upon {ATG5}, a critical autophagy regulator, but the inhibition of {MAVS} signaling did not. These results indicate that {SARS}-{CoV} {ORF}-9b manipulates host cell mitochondria and mitochondrial function to help evade host innate immunity. This study has uncovered an important clue to the pathogenesis of {SARS}-{CoV} infection and illustrates the havoc that a small {ORF} can cause in cells.}

Although people are much more immunologically diverse than conventionally housed animal models, tools and technologies are now available that permit high-throughput analysis of human samples, including both blood and tissues, which will give us deep insights into human immunity in health and disease.

This is due in part to the continual emergence of new viral variants and to synergistic interactions with other viruses and bacteria. There is a lack of understanding about how host responses work to control the infection and how other pathogens capitalize on the altered immune state. The complexity of multi-pathogen infections makes dissecting contributing mechanisms, which may be non-linear and occur on different time scales, challenging. Fortunately, mathematical models have been able to uncover infection control mechanisms, establish regulatory feedbacks, connect mechanisms across time scales, and determine the processes that dictate different disease outcomes. These models have tested existing hypotheses and generated new hypotheses, some of which have been subsequently tested and validated in the laboratory. They have been particularly a key in studying influenza-bacteria coinfections and will be undoubtedly be useful in examining the interplay between influenza virus and other viruses. Here, I review recent advances in modeling influenza-related infections, the novel biological insight that has been gained through modeling, the importance of model-driven experimental design, and future directions of the field. \copyright 2018 The Author.

abstract = {Trade-offs between different components of a pathogen's replication and transmission cycle are thought to be common. A number of studies have identified trade-offs that emerge across scales, reflecting the tension between strategies that optimize within-host proliferation and large-scale population spread. Most of these studies are theoretical in nature, with direct experimental tests of such cross-scale trade-offs still rare. Here, we report an analysis of avian influenza A viruses across scales, focusing on the phenotype of temperature-dependent viral persistence. Taking advantage of a unique dataset that reports both environmental virus decay rates and strain-specific viral kinetics from duck challenge experiments, we show that the temperature-dependent environmental decay rate of a strain does not impact within-host virus load. Hence, for this phenotype, the scales of within-host infection dynamics and between-host environmental persistence do not seem to interact: viral fitness may be optimized on each scale without cross-scale trade-offs. Instead, we confirm the existence of a temperature-dependent persistence trade-off on a single scale, with some strains favouring environmental persistence in water at low temperatures while others reduce sensitivity to increasing temperatures. We show that this temperature-dependent trade-off is a robust phenomenon and does not depend on the details of data analysis. Our findings suggest that viruses might employ different environmental persistence strategies, which facilitates the coexistence of diverse strains in ecological niches. We conclude that a better understanding of the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of influenza A viruses probably requires empirical information regarding both within-host dynamics and environmental traits, integrated within a combined ecological and within-host framework. \copyright 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Here, a rigorous stability analysis of a multiscale model within-host and between-host is presented. The within-host model describes viral replication and the respective immune response while disease transmission is represented by a susceptible-infected model. The bridging of scales from within- to between-host considered transmission as a function of the viral load. Consequently, stability and bifurcation analyses were developed coupling the two basic reproduction numbers [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for the within- and the between-host subsystems, respectively. Local stability results for each subsystem, including a unique stable equilibrium point, recapitulate classical approaches to infection and epidemic control. Using a Lyapunov function, global stability of the between-host system was obtained. Our main result was the derivation of the [Formula: see text] as an increasing function of [Formula: see text]. Numerical analyses reveal that a Michaelis-Menten form based on the virus is more likely to recapitulate the behavior between the scales than a form directly proportional to the virus. Our work contributes basic understandings of the two models and casts light on the potential effects of the coupling function on linking the two scales.}

Here we conduct a community-based analysis to determine whether pre- or early post-exposure molecular factors could predict physiologic responses to viral exposure. Using peripheral blood gene expression profiles collected from healthy subjects prior to exposure to one of four respiratory viruses ({H1N1}, {H3N2}, Rhinovirus, and {RSV}), as well as up to 24 h following exposure, we find that it is possible to construct models predictive of symptomatic response using profiles even prior to viral exposure. Analysis of predictive gene features reveal little overlap among models; however, in aggregate, these genes are enriched for common pathways. Heme metabolism, the most significantly enriched pathway, is associated with a higher risk of developing symptoms following viral exposure. This study demonstrates that pre-exposure molecular predictors can be identified and improves our understanding of the mechanisms of response to respiratory viruses.}

Similar to all other molecular mechanisms that are central to eliciting protective immune responses, {IFN}-I expression is subject to homeostatic controls that regulate cytokine levels upon clearing the infection. However, in the case of established persistent viral infection, sustained elevation of {IFN}-I expression bears deleterious effects to the host and is today considered as the major driver of inflammation and immunosuppression. In fact, numerous emerging studies place sustained {IFN}-I expression as a common nexus in the pathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases including persistent infections with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1), simian immunodeficiency virus ({SIV}), as well as the rodent-borne lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 ({LCMV} clone 13). In this review, we highlight recent studies illustrating the molecular dysregulation and resultant cellular dysfunction in both innate and adaptive immune responses driven by sustained {IFN}-I expression. Here, we place particular emphasis on the efficacy of {IFN}-I receptor ({IFNR}) blockade towards improving immune responses against viral infections given the emerging therapeutic approach of blocking {IFNR} using neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in chronically infected patients.}

A distinct coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) has been identified as the aetiological agent of {SARS}. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) has been identified as the functional receptor for {SARS}-{CoV}. Although {ACE2} {mRNA} is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for {SARS}, the present study investigated the localization of {ACE2} protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of {ACE2} protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, {ACE2} was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, {ACE2} is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the {SARS}-{CoV}. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of {ACE2} in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main {SARS} disease manifestations.

abstract = {The discoveries made over the past few years have modified the current immunological paradigm. It turns out that innate immunity cells can mount some kind of immunological memory, similar to that observed in the acquired immunity and corresponding to the defense mechanisms of lower organisms, which increases their resistance to reinfection. This phenomenon is termed trained innate immunity. It is based on epigenetic changes in innate immune cells (monocytes/macrophages, {NK} cells) after their stimulation with various infectious or non-infectious agents. Many infectious stimuli, including bacterial or fungal cells and their components ({LPS}, \beta-glucan, chitin) as well as viruses or even parasites are considered potent inducers of innate immune memory. Epigenetic cell reprogramming occurring at the heart of the phenomenon may provide a useful basis for designing novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to prevent and protect against multiple diseases. In this article, we present the current state of art on trained innate immunity occurring as a result of infectious agent induction. Additionally, we discuss the mechanisms of cell reprogramming and the implications for immune response stimulation/manipulation.}

abstract = {Influenza A virus ({IAV}) binds its host cell using the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin ({HA}). {HA} recognizes sialic acid, a plasma membrane glycan that functions as the specific primary attachment factor ({AF}). Since sialic acid alone cannot fulfill a signaling function, the virus needs to activate downstream factors to trigger endocytic uptake. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), a member of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family, was shown to be activated by and transmit {IAV} entry signals. However, how {IAV} engages and activates {EGFR} remains largely unclear. We used multicolor super-resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization of both {IAV} attachment factors and its functional receptor at the scale of the {IAV} particle. Intriguingly, quantitative cluster analysis revealed that {AF} and {EGFR} are organized in partially overlapping submicrometer clusters in the apical plasma membrane of A549 cells. Within {AF} domains, which are distinct from microvilli, the local {AF} concentration, a parameter that directly influences virus-cell binding, reaches on average 10-fold the background concentration and tends to increase towards the cluster center, thereby representing a multivalent virus-binding platform. Using our experimentally measured cluster characteristics, we simulated virus diffusion on a membrane, revealing that the distinct mobility pattern of {IAVs} is dominated by the local {AF} concentration, consistent with live cell single-virus tracking data. In contrast to {AF}, {EGFR} resides in clusters of rather low molecular density. Virus binding activates {EGFR}, but interestingly, this process occurs without a major lateral {EGFR} redistribution, instead relying on activation of pre-formed clusters, which we show are long-lived. Taken together, our results provide a quantitative understanding of the initial steps of influenza virus infection. Co-clustering of {AF} and {EGFR} permit a cooperative effect of binding and signaling at specific platforms, and thus we relate their spatial organization to their functional role during virus-cell binding and receptor activation.}

abstract = {Emerging coronaviruses ({CoVs}) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available. The {CoV} nsp14 exoribonuclease ({ExoN}) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity. We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue {GS}-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic {CoVs} in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) mouse model. However, studies with {GS}-5734 have not reported resistance associated with {GS}-5734, nor do we understand the action of {GS}-5734 in wild-type ({WT}) proofreading {CoVs}. Here, we show that {GS}-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus ({MHV}) with similar 50\% effective concentration values ({EC50}) as {SARS}-{CoV} and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}). Passage of {WT} {MHV} in the presence of the {GS}-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all {CoVs} that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to {GS}-5734, as determined by {EC50} The resistant viruses were unable to compete with {WT} in direct coinfection passage in the absence of {GS}-5734. Introduction of the {MHV} resistance mutations into {SARS}-{CoV} resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated {SARS}-{CoV} pathogenesis in a mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an {MHV} mutant lacking {ExoN} proofreading was significantly more sensitive to {GS}-5734. Combined, the results indicate that {GS}-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact {ExoN} proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of {GS}-5734, further supporting the development of {GS}-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging {CoVs}.{IMPORTANCE} Coronaviruses ({CoVs}) cause severe human infections, but there are no approved antivirals to treat these infections. Development of nucleoside-based therapeutics for {CoV} infections has been hampered by the presence of a proofreading exoribonuclease. Here, we expand the known efficacy of the nucleotide prodrug remdesivir ({GS}-5734) to include a group \beta-2a {CoV}. Further, {GS}-5734 potently inhibits {CoVs} with intact proofreading. Following selection with the {GS}-5734 parent nucleoside, 2 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 polymerase at residues that are identical across {CoVs} provide low-level resistance to {GS}-5734. The resistance mutations decrease viral fitness of {MHV} in vitro and attenuate pathogenesis in a {SARS}-{CoV} animal model of infection. Together, these studies define the target of {GS}-5734 activity and demonstrate that resistance is difficult to select, only partial, and impairs fitness and virulence of {MHV} and {SARS}-{CoV}, supporting further development of {GS}-5734 as a potential effective pan-{CoV} antiviral.

abstract = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) is immune-driven pathologies that are observed in severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) infection. {SARS}-{CoV} emerged in 2002 to 2003 and led to a global outbreak of {SARS}. As with the outcome of human infection, intranasal infection of {C57BL}/{6J} mice with mouse-adapted {SARS}-{CoV} results in high-titer virus replication within the lung, induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell infiltration within the lung. Using this model, we investigated the role of the complement system during {SARS}-{CoV} infection. We observed activation of the complement cascade in the lung as early as day 1 following {SARS}-{CoV} infection. To test whether this activation contributed to protective or pathologic outcomes, we utilized mice deficient in C3 (C3-/-), the central component of the complement system. Relative to {C57BL}/{6J} control mice, {SARS}-{CoV}-infected C3-/- mice exhibited significantly less weight loss and less respiratory dysfunction despite equivalent viral loads in the lung. Significantly fewer neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were present in the lungs of C3-/- mice than in {C56BL}/{6J} controls, and subsequent studies revealed reduced lung pathology and lower cytokine and chemokine levels in both the lungs and the sera of C3-/- mice than in controls. These studies identify the complement system as an important host mediator of {SARS}-{CoV}-induced disease and suggest that complement activation regulates a systemic proinflammatory response to {SARS}-{CoV} infection. Furthermore, these data suggest that {SARS}-{CoV}-mediated disease is largely immune driven and that inhibiting complement signaling after {SARS}-{CoV} infection might function as an effective immune therapeutic.{IMPORTANCE} The complement system is a critical part of host defense to many bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. It works alongside pattern recognition receptors to stimulate host defense systems in advance of activation of the adaptive immune response. In this study, we directly test the role of complement in {SARS}-{CoV} pathogenesis using a mouse model and show that respiratory disease is significantly reduced in the absence of complement even though viral load is unchanged. Complement-deficient mice have reduced neutrophilia in their lungs and reduced systemic inflammation, consistent with the observation that {SARS}-{CoV} pathogenesis is an immune-driven disease. These data suggest that inhibition of complement signaling might be an effective treatment option following coronavirus infection. Copyright \copyright 2018 Gralinski et al.}

abstract = {Interferons ({IFNs}) can serve as the first line of immune defense against viral infection. The identification of {IFN}-\lambdas 1, 2, 3 \& 4 (termed as type {III} {IFNs}) has revealed that the antiviral immune response to viruses contains more components than the type I {IFNs} that have been known for more than 50 years. {IFN}-\lambdas are {IFN}-\lambda1 ({IL}-29), {IFN}-\lambda2 ({IL}-28a), {IFN}-\lambda3 ({IL}-28b) and {IFN}-\lambda4, which resembles {IFN}-\lambda3. {IFN}-\lambdas have type I-{IFN}-like immune responses and biological activities, but our knowledge of these novel players in the antiviral response is not well established. In this review, we try to describe the current information on the expression and function of {IFN}-\lambdas in the innate antiviral immune defense and {IFN}-\lambda2's role in regulating and shaping the adaptive immune response. We suggest that {IFN}-\lambdas are key antiviral cytokines, directly performing an antiviral immune response at epithelial surfaces in the early stages of viral infection, and that these cytokines also skew the balance of Th1 and Th2 cells to Th1 phenotype. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in {IFN}-\lambda genes can impair antiviral immune responses in clinical treatment. \copyright 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger {AG}, Basel.}

abstract = {An implicit aim in cellular infection biology is to understand the mechanisms how viruses, microbes, eukaryotic parasites, and fungi usurp the functions of host cells and cause disease. Mechanistic insight is a deep understanding of the biophysical and biochemical processes that give rise to an observable phenomenon. It is typically subject to falsification, that is, it is accessible to experimentation and empirical data acquisition. This is different from logic and mathematics, which are not empirical, but built on systems of inherently consistent axioms. Here, we argue that modeling and computer simulation, combined with mechanistic insights, yields unprecedented deep understanding of phenomena in biology and especially in virus infections by providing a way of showing sufficiency of a hypothetical mechanism. This ideally complements the necessity statements accessible to empirical falsification by additional positive evidence. We discuss how computational implementations of mathematical models can assist and enhance the quantitative measurements of infection dynamics of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and thereby help generating causal insights into virus infection biology.}

abstract = {Viral kinetic ({VK}) modeling has led to increased understanding of the within host dynamics of viral infections and the effects of therapy. Here we review recent developments in the modeling of viral infection kinetics with emphasis on two infectious diseases: hepatitis C and influenza. We review how {VK} modeling has evolved from simple models of viral infections treated with a drug or drug cocktail with an assumed constant effectiveness to models that incorporate drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as phenomenological models that simply assume drugs have time varying-effectiveness. We also discuss multiscale models that include intracellular events in viral replication, models of drug-resistance, models that include innate and adaptive immune responses and models that incorporate cell-to-cell spread of infection. Overall, {VK} modeling has provided new insights into the understanding of the disease progression and the modes of action of several drugs. We expect that {VK} modeling will be increasingly used in the coming years to optimize drug regimens in order to improve therapeutic outcomes and treatment tolerability for infectious diseases.}

abstract = {Influenza A viruses are respiratory pathogens that cause seasonal epidemics with up to 500,000 deaths each year. Yet there are currently only two classes of antivirals licensed for treatment and drug-resistant strains are on the rise. A major challenge for the discovery of new anti-influenza agents is the identification of drug targets that efficiently interfere with viral replication. To support this step, we developed a multiscale model of influenza A virus infection which comprises both the intracellular level where the virus synthesizes its proteins, replicates its genome, and assembles new virions and the extracellular level where it spreads to new host cells. This integrated modeling approach recapitulates a wide range of experimental data across both scales including the time course of all three viral {RNA} species inside an infected cell and the infection dynamics in a cell population. It also allowed us to systematically study how interfering with specific steps of the viral life cycle affects virus production. We find that inhibitors of viral transcription, replication, protein synthesis, nuclear export, and assembly/release are most effective in decreasing virus titers whereas targeting virus entry primarily delays infection. In addition, our results suggest that for some antivirals therapy success strongly depends on the lifespan of infected cells and, thus, on the dynamics of virus-induced apoptosis or the host's immune response. Hence, the proposed model provides a systems-level understanding of influenza A virus infection and therapy as well as an ideal platform to include further levels of complexity toward a comprehensive description of infectious diseases.}

Since the 3a protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER})-Golgi compartment, its role in causing {ER} stress was investigated in transiently transfected cells. Cells expressing the 3a proteins showed {ER} stress based on activation of genes for the {ER} chaperones {GRP78} and {GRP94}. Since {ER} stress can cause differential modulation of the unfolded protein response ({UPR}), which includes the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 ({IRE}-1), activating transcription factor 6 ({ATF6}) and {PKR}-like {ER} kinase ({PERK}) pathways, these were individually tested in 3a-expressing cells. Only the {PERK} pathway was found to be activated in 3a-expressing cells based on (1) increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha ({eIF2alpha}) and inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative form of {eIF2alpha} on {GRP78} promoter activity, (2) increased translation of activating transcription factor 4 ({ATF4}) {mRNA}, and (3) {ATF4}-dependent activation of the C/{EBP} homologous protein ({CHOP}) gene promoter. Activation of {PERK} affects innate immunity by suppression of type 1 interferon ({IFN}) signaling. The 3a protein was found to induce serine phosphorylation within the {IFN} alpha-receptor subunit 1 ({IFNAR1}) degradation motif and to increase {IFNAR1} ubiquitination. Confocal microscopic analysis showed increased translocation of {IFNAR1} into the lysosomal compartment and flow cytometry showed reduced levels of {IFNAR1} in 3a-expressing cells. These results provide further mechanistic details of the pro-apoptotic effects of the {SARS}-{CoV} 3a protein, and suggest a potential role for it in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity.}

Surprisingly, the activated {PLC\gamma}-1 signaling is not important for viral replication in macrophages, but is involved in the virus-induced inflammatory responses. {PLC}-\gamma1-specific inhibitor U73122 strongly inhibits the {H1N1} virus-induced {NF}-{\kappaB} signaling, blocking the up-regulation of {TNF}-\alpha, {IL}-6, {MIP}-1\alpha, and reactive oxidative species. In a positive feedback loop, {IL}-1\beta and {TNF}-\alpha activate the {PLC\gamma}-1 signaling in both epithelial and macrophage cell lines. In summary, we have shown for the first time that the {PLC\gamma}-1 signaling plays an important role in the {H1N1}-induced inflammatory responses. Our study suggests that targeting the {PLC\gamma}-1 signaling is a potential antiviral therapy against {H1N1} by inhibiting both viral replication and excessive inflammation.

Based on Ordinary Differential Equation ({ODE}) formalism, a computational model was developed for the in-host response to influenza A virus, merging inflammatory, innate, adaptive and humoral responses to virus and linking severity of infection, the inflammatory response, and mortality. The model was calibrated using dense cytokine and cell data from adult {BALB}/c mice infected with the {H1N1} influenza strain A/{PR}/8/34 in sublethal and lethal doses. Uncertainty in model parameters and disease mechanisms was quantified using Bayesian inference and ensemble model methodology that generates probabilistic predictions of survival, defined as viral clearance and recovery of the respiratory epithelium. The ensemble recovers the expected relationship between magnitude of viral exposure and the duration of survival, and suggests mechanisms primarily responsible for survival, which could guide the development of immuno-modulatory interventions as adjuncts to current anti-viral treatments. The model is employed to extrapolate from available data survival curves for the population and their dependence on initial viral aliquot. In addition, the model allows us to illustrate the positive effect of controlled inflammation on influenza survival. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Measurement of changes in protein levels and in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can be highly informative about the phenotypic consequences of genetic differences or about the dynamics of cellular processes. Typically, such proteomic profiles are interpreted intuitively or by simple correlation analysis. Here, we present a computational method to generate causal explanations for proteomic profiles using prior mechanistic knowledge in the literature, as recorded in cellular pathway maps. To demonstrate its potential, we use this method to analyze the cascading events after an {EGF} stimulation of a cell line, to discover new pathways in platelet activation, to discover influential regulators of oncoproteins in breast cancer, to describe signaling characteristics in predefined subtypes of ovarian and breast cancers, and to highlight which pathway relations are most frequently activated across 32 different cancer types. Causal pathway analysis, that combines genetic and molecular profiles with prior biological knowledge captured in computational form, may become a powerful discovery tool as the amount and quality of cellular profiling rapidly expands.}

abstract = {In the temperate regions, seasonal influenza virus outbreaks correlate closely with decreases in humidity. While low ambient humidity is known to enhance viral transmission, its impact on host response to influenza virus infection and disease outcome remains unclear. Here, we showed that housing Mx1 congenic mice in low relative humidity makes mice more susceptible to severe disease following respiratory challenge with influenza A virus. We find that inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11-deficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing revealed that induction of {IFN}-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology.

abstract = {The spread of viral pathogens both between and within hosts is inherently a spatial process. While the spatial aspects of viral spread at the epidemiological level have been increasingly well characterized, the spatial aspects of viral spread within infected hosts are still understudied. Here, with a focus on influenza A viruses ({IAVs}), we first review experimental studies that have shed light on the mechanisms and spatial dynamics of viral spread within hosts. These studies provide strong empirical evidence for highly localized {IAV} spread within hosts. Since mathematical and computational within-host models have been increasingly used to gain a quantitative understanding of observed viral dynamic patterns, we then review the (relatively few) computational modeling studies that have shed light on possible factors that structure the dynamics of spatial within-host {IAV} spread. These factors include the dispersal distance of virions, the localization of the immune response, and heterogeneity in host cell phenotypes across the respiratory tract. While informative, we find in these studies a striking absence of theoretical expectations of how spatial dynamics may impact the dynamics of viral populations. To mitigate this, we turn to the extensive ecological and evolutionary literature on range expansions to provide informed theoretical expectations. We find that factors such as the type of density dependence, the frequency of long-distance dispersal, specific life history characteristics, and the extent of spatial heterogeneity are critical factors affecting the speed of population spread and the genetic composition of spatially expanding populations. For each factor that we identified in the theoretical literature, we draw parallels to its analog in viral populations. We end by discussing current knowledge gaps related to the spatial component of within-host {IAV} spread and the potential for within-host spatial considerations to inform the development of disease control strategies.}

Several {FDA}-approved drugs, including selective estrogen receptor modulators ({SERMs}), possess selective anti-Ebola activities. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of these drugs remain elusive. By analyzing the structures of {SERMs} and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by {SERMs} could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection. Herein, we demonstrated that the same dosages of {SERMs} which induced cholesterol accumulation also inhibited Ebola infection. {SERMs} reduced the cellular sphingosine and subsequently caused endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn led to blocking the Ebola entry. Our study clarified the specific anti-Ebola mechanism of {SERMs}, even the cationic amphiphilic drugs ({CADs}), this mechanism led to the endolysosomal calcium as a critical target for development of anti-Ebola drugs.}

In return, cytokines can affect the metabolism of virus-infected and bystander cells to impede viral replication processes. This review aims to summarize our current understanding of the cross-talk between metabolic reprogramming and cytokine responses, and to highlight future potential research topics.

abstract = {The replication of coronavirus, a family of important animal and human pathogens, is closely associated with the cellular membrane compartments, especially the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}). Coronavirus infection of cultured cells was previously shown to cause {ER} stress and induce the unfolded protein response ({UPR}), a process that aims to restore the {ER} homeostasis by global translation shutdown and increasing the {ER} folding capacity. However, under prolonged {ER} stress, {UPR} can also induce apoptotic cell death. Accumulating evidence from recent studies has shown that induction of {ER} stress and {UPR} may constitute a major aspect of coronavirus-host interaction. Activation of the three branches of {UPR} modulates a wide variety of signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein ({MAP}) kinase activation, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immune response. {ER} stress and {UPR} activation may therefore contribute significantly to the viral replication and pathogenesis during coronavirus infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on coronavirus-induced {ER} stress and {UPR} activation, with emphasis on their cross-talking to apoptotic signaling.}

We focus specifically upon mechanistic questions relating to human viral infection, tumour growth and metastasis and T cell activation. These exemplar applications highlight the potential of this approach to impact upon human immunology informed by ever-expanding experimental, clinical and 'omics' data. Despite the capacity of mechanistic modelling to accelerate therapeutic discovery and development and to de-risk clinical trial design, it is not utilized widely across the field. We outline ongoing challenges facing the integration of mechanistic modelling with experimental and clinical immunology, and suggest how these may be overcome.

abstract = {Motivation: In recent years, there has been great progress in the field of automated curation of biomedical networks and models, aided by text mining methods that provide evidence from literature. Such methods must not only extract snippets of text that relate to model interactions, but also be able to contextualize the evidence and provide additional confidence scores for the interaction in question. Although various approaches calculating confidence scores have focused primarily on the quality of the extracted information, there has been little work on exploring the textual uncertainty conveyed by the author. Despite textual uncertainty being acknowledged in biomedical text mining as an attribute of text mined interactions (events), it is significantly understudied as a means of providing a confidence measure for interactions in pathways or other biomedical models. In this work, we focus on improving identification of textual uncertainty for events and explore how it can be used as an additional measure of confidence for biomedical models. Results: We present a novel method for extracting uncertainty from the literature using a hybrid approach that combines rule induction and machine learning. Variations of this hybrid approach are then discussed, alongside their advantages and disadvantages. We use subjective logic theory to combine multiple uncertainty values extracted from different sources for the same interaction. Our approach achieves F-scores of 0.76 and 0.88 based on the {BioNLP}-{ST} and Genia-{MK} corpora, respectively, making considerable improvements over previously published work. Moreover, we evaluate our proposed system on pathways related to two different areas, namely leukemia and melanoma cancer research. Availability and implementation: The leukemia pathway model used is available in Pathway Studio while the Ras model is available via {PathwayCommons}.

abstract = {Influenza A virus ({IAV}) infections are a major cause for respiratory disease in humans, which affects all age groups and contributes substantially to global morbidity and mortality. {IAV} have a large natural host reservoir in avian species. However, many avian {IAV} strains lack adaptation to other hosts and hardly propagate in humans. While seasonal or pandemic {IAV} strains replicate efficiently in permissive human cells, many avian {IAV} cause abortive nonproductive infections in these hosts despite successful cell entry. However, the precise reasons for these differential outcomes are poorly defined. We hypothesized that the distinct course of an {IAV} infection with a given virus strain is determined by the differential interplay between specific host and viral factors. By using Spike-in {SILAC} mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics we characterized sets of cellular factors whose abundance is specifically up- or downregulated in the course of permissive versus nonpermissive {IAV} infection, respectively. This approach allowed for the definition and quantitative comparison of about 3500 proteins in human lung epithelial cells in response to seasonal or low-pathogenic avian {H3N2} {IAV}. Many identified proteins were similarly regulated by both virus strains, but also 16 candidates with distinct changes in permissive versus nonpermissive infection were found. {RNAi}-mediated knockdown of these differentially regulated host factors identified Vpr binding protein ({VprBP}) as proviral host factor because its downregulation inhibited efficient propagation of seasonal {IAV} whereas overexpression increased viral replication of both seasonal and avian {IAV}. These results not only show that there are similar differences in the overall changes during permissive and nonpermissive influenza virus infections, but also provide a basis to evaluate {VprBP} as novel anti-{IAV} drug target. \copyright 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

abstract = {Early interactions of influenza A virus ({IAV}) with respiratory epithelium might determine the outcome of infection. The study of global cellular innate immune responses often masks multiple aspects of the mechanisms by which populations of cells work as organized and heterogeneous systems to defeat virus infection, and how the virus counteracts these systems. In this study, we experimentally dissected the dynamics of {IAV} and human epithelial respiratory cell interaction during early infection at the single-cell level. We found that the number of viruses infecting a cell (multiplicity of infection [{MOI}]) influences the magnitude of virus antagonism of the host innate antiviral response. Infections performed at high {MOIs} resulted in increased viral gene expression per cell and stronger antagonist effect than infections at low {MOIs}. In addition, single-cell patterns of expression of interferons ({IFN}) and {IFN}-stimulated genes ({ISGs}) provided important insights into the contributions of the infected and bystander cells to the innate immune responses during infection. Specifically, the expression of multiple {ISGs} was lower in infected than in bystander cells. In contrast with other {IFNs}, {IFN} lambda 1 ({IFNL1}) showed a widespread pattern of expression, suggesting a different cell-to-cell propagation mechanism more reliant on paracrine signaling. Finally, we measured the dynamics of the antiviral response in primary human epithelial cells, which highlighted the importance of early innate immune responses at inhibiting virus spread.{IMPORTANCE} Influenza A virus ({IAV}) is a respiratory pathogen of high importance to public health. Annual epidemics of seasonal {IAV} infections in humans are a significant public health and economic burden. {IAV} also causes sporadic pandemics, which can have devastating effects. The main target cells for {IAV} replication are epithelial cells in the respiratory epithelium. The cellular innate immune responses induced in these cells upon infection are critical for defense against the virus, and therefore, it is important to understand the complex interactions between the virus and the host cells. In this study, we investigated the innate immune response to {IAV} in the respiratory epithelium at the single-cell level, providing a better understanding on how a population of epithelial cells functions as a complex system to orchestrate the response to virus infection and how the virus counteracts this system.

abstract = {The human innate immune response, particularly the type-I interferon ({IFN}) response, is highly robust and effective first line of defense against virus invasion. {IFN} molecules are produced and secreted from infected cells upon virus infection and recognition.

Previous experimental studies have identified the detailed molecular mechanisms for the {IFN} signaling and response. However, the principles underlying how host cells use {IFN} to communicate with each other to collectively and robustly halt an infection is not understood. Here we take a multiplex network modeling approach to provide a theoretical framework to identify key factors that determine the effectiveness of the {IFN} response against virus infection of a host. In this approach, we consider the virus spread among host cells and the interferon signaling to protect host cells as a competition process on a two-layer multiplex network. We focused on two types of network topology, i.e., the Erdős-Rényi ({ER}) network and the Geometric Random ({GR}) network, which represent the scenarios when infection of cells is mostly well mixed (e.g., in the blood) and when infection is spatially segregated (e.g., in tissues), respectively. We show that in general, the {IFN} response works effectively to stop viral infection when virus infection spreads spatially (a most likely scenario for initial virus infection of a host at the peripheral tissue). Importantly, we show that the effectiveness of the {IFN} response is robust against large variations in the distance of {IFN} diffusion as long as {IFNs} diffuse faster than viruses and they can effectively induce antiviral responses in susceptible host cells. This suggests that the effectiveness of the {IFN} response is insensitive to the specific arrangement of host cells in peripheral tissues. Thus, our work provides a quantitative explanation of why the {IFN} response can serve an effective and robust response in different tissue types to a wide range of viral infections of a host.}

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can provide in-depth information on the molecular mechanisms involved in immune responses. Areas covered: Summarized are the key immunology findings obtained with {MS}-based proteomics in the past five years, with a focus on inflammasome activation, global protein secretion, mucosal immunology, immunopeptidome and T cells. Special focus is on extracellular vesicle-mediated protein secretion and its role in immune responses. Expert commentary: Proteomics is an essential part of modern omics-scale immunology research. To date, {MS}-based proteomics has been used in immunology to study protein expression levels, their subcellular localization, secretion, post-translational modifications, and interactions in immune cells upon activation by different stimuli. These studies have made major contributions to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. New developments in proteomics offer constantly novel possibilities for exploring the immune system. Examples of these techniques include mass cytometry and different {MS}-based imaging approaches which can be widely used in immunology.}

abstract = {Despite high sequence similarity between pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses, there is extreme variation in host pathogenicity from one viral strain to the next. Identifying the underlying mechanisms of variability in pathogenicity is a critical task for understanding influenza virus infection and effective management of highly pathogenic influenza virus disease. We applied a network-based modeling approach to identify critical functions related to influenza virus pathogenicity using large transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from mice infected with six influenza virus strains or mutants. Our analysis revealed two pathogenicity-related gene expression clusters; these results were corroborated by matching proteomics data. We also identified parallel downstream processes that were altered during influenza pathogenesis. We found that network bottlenecks (nodes that bridge different network regions) were highly enriched in pathogenicity-related genes, while network hubs (highly connected network nodes) were significantly depleted in these genes. We confirmed that this trend persisted in a distinct virus: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ({SARS}). The role of epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) in influenza pathogenesis, one of the bottleneck regulators with corroborating signals across transcript and protein expression data, was tested and validated in additional mouse infection experiments. We demonstrate that {EGFR} is important during influenza infection, but the role it plays changes for lethal versus non-lethal infections. Our results show that by using association networks, bottleneck genes that lack hub characteristics can be used to predict a gene's involvement in influenza virus pathogenicity. We also demonstrate the utility of employing multiple network approaches for analyzing host response data from viral infections.

abstract = {Mathematical modelling approaches have granted a significant contribution to life sciences and beyond to understand experimental results. However, incomplete and inadequate assessments in parameter estimation practices hamper the parameter reliability, and consequently the insights that ultimately could arise from a mathematical model. To keep the diligent works in modelling biological systems from being mistrusted, potential sources of error must be acknowledged. Employing a popular mathematical model in viral infection research, existing means and practices in parameter estimation are exemplified. Numerical results show that poor experimental data is a main source that can lead to erroneous parameter estimates despite the use of innovative parameter estimation algorithms. Arbitrary choices of initial conditions as well as data asynchrony distort the parameter estimates but are often overlooked in modelling studies. This work stresses the existence of several sources of error buried in reports of modelling biological systems, voicing the need for assessing the sources of error, consolidating efforts in solving the immediate difficulties, and possibly reconsidering the use of mathematical modelling to quantify experimental data.}

Here we focus on two: within-host, that is, how an infection progresses inside a single individual (for instance viral and immune dynamics), and between-host, that is, how the infection is transmitted between multiple individuals of a host population. The dynamics of each of these may be influenced by the other, particularly across evolutionary time. Thus understanding each of these scales, and the links between them, is necessary for a holistic understanding of the spread of infectious diseases. One approach to combining these scales is through mathematical modeling. We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on multi-scale mathematical models of disease transmission (as defined by combining within-host and between-host scales) to determine the extent to which mathematical models are being used to understand across-scale transmission, and the extent to which these models are being confronted with data. Following the {PRISMA} guidelines for systematic reviews, we identified 24 of 197 qualifying papers across 30 years that include both linked models at the within and between host scales and that used data to parameterize/calibrate models. We find that the approach that incorporates both modeling with data is under-utilized, if increasing. This highlights the need for better communication and collaboration between modelers and empiricists to build well-calibrated models that both improve understanding and may be used for prediction.}

Understanding the control mechanisms of influenza infection and dynamics is crucial and could result in effective future treatment strategies. Many kinetic models based on differential equations have been developed in recent decades to capture viral dynamics within a host. These models differ in their complexity in terms of number of species elements and number of reactions. Here, we present a new approach to understanding the overall structure of twelve influenza A virus infection models and their relationship to each other. To this end, we apply chemical organization theory to obtain a hierarchical decomposition of the models into chemical organizations. The decomposition is based on the model structure (reaction rules) but is independent of kinetic details such as rate constants. We found different types of model structures ranging from two to eight organizations. Furthermore, the model's organizations imply a partial order among models entailing a hierarchy of model, revealing a high model diversity with respect to their long-term behavior. Our methods and results can be helpful in model development and model integration, also beyond the influenza area.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Mathematical modeling is now frequently used in outbreak investigations to understand underlying mechanisms of infectious disease dynamics, assess patterns in epidemiological data, and forecast the trajectory of epidemics. However, the successful application of mathematical models to guide public health interventions lies in the ability to reliably estimate model parameters and their corresponding uncertainty. Here, we present and illustrate a simple computational method for assessing parameter identifiability in compartmental epidemic models. {METHODS}: We describe a parametric bootstrap approach to generate simulated data from dynamical systems to quantify parameter uncertainty and identifiability. We calculate confidence intervals and mean squared error of estimated parameter distributions to assess parameter identifiability. To demonstrate this approach, we begin with a low-complexity {SEIR} model and work through examples of increasingly more complex compartmental models that correspond with applications to pandemic influenza, Ebola, and Zika. {RESULTS}: Overall, parameter identifiability issues are more likely to arise with more complex models (based on number of equations/states and parameters). As the number of parameters being jointly estimated increases, the uncertainty surrounding estimated parameters tends to increase, on average, as well. We found that, in most cases, R0 is often robust to parameter identifiability issues affecting individual parameters in the model. Despite large confidence intervals and higher mean squared error of other individual model parameters, R0 can still be estimated with precision and accuracy. {CONCLUSIONS}: Because public health policies can be influenced by results of mathematical modeling studies, it is important to conduct parameter identifiability analyses prior to fitting the models to available data and to report parameter estimates with quantified uncertainty. The method described is helpful in these regards and enhances the essential toolkit for conducting model-based inferences using compartmental dynamic models.}

The data available to estimate the overall {CFR} are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall {CFR}-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative {CFR} for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential {CFR} among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.}

abstract = {There are striking similarities between the strategies ant colonies use to forage for food and immune systems use to search for pathogens. Searchers (ants and cells) use the appropriate combination of random and directed motion, direct and indirect agent-agent interactions, and traversal of physical structures to solve search problems in a variety of environments. An effective immune response requires immune cells to search efficiently and effectively for diverse types of pathogens in different tissues and organs, just as different species of ants have evolved diverse search strategies to forage effectively for a variety of resources in a variety of habitats. Successful T cell search is required to initiate the adaptive immune response in lymph nodes and to eradicate pathogens at sites of infection in peripheral tissue. Ant search strategies suggest novel predictions about T cell search. In both systems, the distribution of targets in time and space determines the most effective search strategy. We hypothesize that the ability of searchers to sense and adapt to dynamic targets and environmental conditions enhances search effectiveness through adjustments to movement and communication patterns. We also suggest that random motion is a more important component of search strategies than is generally recognized. The behavior we observe in ants reveals general design principles and constraints that govern distributed adaptive search in a wide variety of complex systems, particularly the immune system.}

abstract = {It was recently reported that acute influenza infection of the lung promoted distal melanoma growth in the dermis of mice. Melanoma-specific {CD8}+ T cells were shunted to the lung in the presence of the infection, where they expressed high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker {PD}-1, and became incapable of migrating back to the tumor site. At the same time, co-infection virus-specific {CD8}+ T cells remained functional while the infection was cleared. It was also unexpectedly found that {PD}-1 blockade immunotherapy reversed this effect. Here, we proceed to ground the experimental observations in a mechanistic immunobiochemical model that incorporates T cell pathways that control {PD}-1 expression. A core component of our model is a kinetic motif, which we call a {PD}-1 Double Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop ({DIFFL}), and which reflects known interactions between {IRF4}, Blimp-1, and Bcl-6. The different activity levels of the {PD}-1 {DIFFL} components, as a function of the cognate antigen levels and the given inflammation context, manifest themselves in phenotypically distinct outcomes. Collectively, the model allowed us to put forward a few working hypotheses as follows: (i) the melanoma-specific {CD8}+ T cells re-circulating with the blood flow enter the lung where they express high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker {PD}-1 in the presence of infection; (ii) when {PD}-1 receptors interact with abundant {PD}-L1, constitutively expressed in the lung, T cells loose motility; (iii) at the same time, virus-specific cells adapt to strong stimulation by their cognate antigen by lowering the transiently-elevated expression of {PD}-1, remaining functional and mobile in the inflamed lung, while the infection is cleared. The role that T cell receptor ({TCR}) activation and feedback loops play in the underlying processes are also highlighted and discussed. We hope that the results reported in our study could potentially contribute to the advancement of immunological approaches to cancer treatment and, as well, to a better understanding of a broader complexity of fundamental interactions between pathogens and tumors.}

abstract = {All protective and pathogenic immune and inflammatory responses rely heavily on leukocyte migration and localization. Chemokines are secreted chemoattractants that orchestrate the positioning and migration of leukocytes through concentration gradients. The mechanisms underlying chemokine gradient establishment and control include physical as well as biological phenomena. Mathematical models offer the potential to both understand this complexity and suggest interventions to modulate immune function. Constructing models that have powerful predictive capability relies on experimental data to estimate model parameters accurately, but even with a reductionist approach most experiments include multiple cell types, competing interdependent processes and considerable uncertainty. Therefore, we propose the use of reduced modeling and experimental frameworks in complement, to minimize the number of parameters to be estimated. We present a Bayesian optimization framework that accounts for advection and diffusion of a chemokine surrogate and the chemokine {CCL19}, transport processes that are known to contribute to the establishment of spatio-temporal chemokine gradients. Three examples are provided that demonstrate the estimation of the governing parameters as well as the underlying uncertainty. This study demonstrates how a synergistic approach between experimental and computational modeling benefits from the Bayesian approach to provide a robust analysis of chemokine transport. It provides a building block for a larger research effort to gain holistic insight and generate novel and testable hypotheses in chemokine biology and leukocyte trafficking.

abstract = {Most mathematical models that describe the individual or collective actions of cells aim at creating faithful representations of limited sets of data in a self-consistent manner. Consistency with relevant physiological rules pertaining to the greater picture is rarely imposed. By themselves, such models have limited predictive or even explanatory value, contrary to standard claims. Here I try to show that a more critical examination of currently held paradigms is necessary and could potentially lead to models that pass the test of time. In considering the evolution of paradigms over the past decades I focus on the "smart surveillance" theory of how T cells can respond differentially, individually and collectively, to both self- and foreign antigens depending on various "contextual" parameters. The overall perspective is that physiological messages to cells are encoded not only in the biochemical connections of signaling molecules to the cellular machinery but also in the magnitude, kinetics, and in the time- and space-contingencies, of sets of stimuli. By rationalizing the feasibility of subthreshold interactions, the "dynamic tuning hypothesis," a central component of the theory, set the ground for further theoretical and experimental explorations of dynamically regulated immune tolerance, homeostasis and diversity, and of the notion that lymphocytes participate in nonclassical physiological functions. Some of these efforts are reviewed. Another focus of this review is the concomitant regulation of immune activation and homeostasis through the operation of a feedback mechanism controlling the balance between renewal and differentiation of activated cells. Different perspectives on the nature and regulation of chronic immune activation in {HIV} infection have led to conflicting models of {HIV} pathogenesis-a major area of research for theoretical immunologists over almost three decades-and can have profound impact on ongoing {HIV} cure strategies. Altogether, this critical review is intended to constructively influence the outlook of prospective model builders and of interested immunologists on the state of the art and to encourage conceptual work.

abstract = {The host immune response against infection requires the coordinated action of many diverse cell subsets that dynamically adapt to a pathogen threat. Due to the complexity of such a response, most immunological studies have focused on a few genes, proteins, or cell types. With the development of "omic"-technologies and computational analysis methods, attempts to analyze and understand complex system dynamics are now feasible. However, the decomposition of transcriptomic data sets generated from complete organs remains a major challenge. Here, we combined Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis ({WGCNA}) and Digital Cell Quantifier ({DCQ}) to analyze time-resolved mouse splenic transcriptomes in acute and chronic Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus ({LCMV}) infections. This enabled us to generate hypotheses about complex immune functioning after a virus-induced perturbation. This strategy was validated by successfully predicting several known immune phenomena, such as effector cytotoxic T lymphocyte ({CTL}) expansion and exhaustion. Furthermore, we predicted and subsequently verified experimentally macrophage-{CD8} T cell cooperativity and the participation of virus-specific {CD8}+ T cells with an early effector transcriptome profile in the host adaptation to chronic infection. Thus, the linking of gene expression changes with immune cell kinetics provides novel insights into the complex immune processes within infected tissues.}

abstract = {Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients. Conidia that reach the lower respiratory tract are confronted with alveolar macrophages, which are the resident phagocytic cells, constituting the first line of defense. If not efficiently removed in time, A. fumigatus conidia can germinate causing severe infections associated with high mortality rates. Mice are the most extensively used model organism in research on A. fumigatus infections. However, in addition to structural differences in the lung physiology of mice and the human host, applied infection doses in animal experiments are typically orders of magnitude larger compared to the daily inhalation doses of humans. The influence of these factors, which must be taken into account in a quantitative comparison and knowledge transfer from mice to humans, is difficult to measure since in vivo live cell imaging of the infection dynamics under physiological conditions is currently not possible. In the present study, we compare A. fumigatus infection in mice and humans by virtual infection modeling using a hybrid agent-based model that accounts for the respective lung physiology and the impact of a wide range of infection doses on the spatial infection dynamics. Our computer simulations enable comparative quantification of A. fumigatus infection clearance in the two hosts to elucidate (i) the complex interplay between alveolar morphometry and the fungal burden and (ii) the dynamics of infection clearance, which for realistic fungal burdens is found to be more efficiently realized in mice compared to humans.}

Here, we found that progranulin ({PGRN}) was significantly increased both in vitro and in vivo during influenza virus infection. Using a {PGRN} knockdown assay and {PGRN}-deficient mice model, we demonstrated that influenza virus-inducing {PGRN} negatively regulated type I {IFNs} production by inhibiting the activation of {NF}-{\kappaB} and {IRF3} signaling. Furthermore, we showed that {PGRN} directly interacted with {NF}-{\kappaB} essential modulator ({NEMO}) via its Grn {CDE} domains. We also verified that {PGRN} recruited A20 to deubiquitinate K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on {NEMO} at K264. In addition, we found that macrophage played a major source of {PGRN} during influenza virus infection, and {PGRN} neutralizing antibodies could protect against influenza virus-induced lethality in mice. Our data identify a {PGRN}-mediated {IFN} evasion pathway exploited by influenza virus with implication in antiviral applications. These findings also provide insights into the functions and crosstalk of {PGRN} in innate immunity.}

abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: Interferon-alpha ({IFN}-\alpha) exhibits its antiviral activity through signal transducer and activator of transcription protein ({STAT}) signaling and the expression of {IFN} response genes ({IRGs}). Viral infection has been shown to result in activation of epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR})-a host cell entry factor used by several viruses, including hepatitis C virus. However, the effect of {EGFR} activation for cellular antiviral responses is unknown. Here, we uncover cross-talk between {EGFR} and {IFN}-\alpha signaling that has a therapeutic effect on {IFN}-\alpha-based therapies and functional relevance for viral evasion and {IFN} resistance. We show that combining {IFN}-\alpha with the {EGFR} inhibitor, erlotinib, potentiates the antiviral effect of each compound in a highly synergistic manner. The extent of the synergy correlated with reduced {STAT3} phosphorylation in the presence of erlotinib, whereas {STAT1} phosphorylation was not affected. Furthermore, reduced {STAT3} phosphorylation correlated with enhanced expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 ({SOCS3}) in the presence of erlotinib and enhanced expression of the {IRGs}, radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 and myxovirus resistance protein 1. Moreover, {EGFR} stimulation reduced {STAT1} dimerization, but not phosphorylation, indicating that {EGFR} cross-talk with {IFN} signaling acts on the {STATs} at the level of binding {DNA}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results support a model where inhibition of {EGFR} signaling impairs {STAT3} phosphorylation, leading to enhanced {IRG} expression and antiviral activity. These data uncover a novel role of {EGFR} signaling in the antiviral activity of {IFN}-\alpha and open new avenues of improving the efficacy of {IFN}-\alpha-based antiviral therapies.

The medical readiness of treating patients suffering from such infections is a prerequisite of an effective civil defense system. Currently the only therapeutic option for the treatment of poxvirus infections relies on the virostatic nulceosid analog cidofovir, although severe side effects and drug resistant strains have been described. A growing understanding of poxvirus pathogenesis raises the possibility to explore other appropriate targets involved in the viral replication cycle. Poxvirus encoded growth factors such as the Vaccinia Growth Factor ({VGF}) stimulate host cells via the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ({EGFR}) and thereby facilitate viral spreading. In this study we could visualize for the first time the paracrine priming of uninfected cells for subsequent infection by orthopoxviruses directly linked to {EGFR} phosphorylation. Since {EGFR} is a well known target for anti-tumor therapy small molecules for inhibition of its tyrosine kinase ({TK}) activity are readily available and clinically evaluated. In this study we analyzed three different {EGFR} receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for inhibition of orthopoxvirus infection in epithelial cells. The inhibitor shown to be most effective was Gefitinib (Iressa) which is already approved as a drug for anti-tumor medication in the {USA} and in Europe. Thus Gefitnib may provide a new therapeutic option for single or combination therapy of acute poxvirus infections, acting on a cellular target and thus reducing the risk of viral resistance to treatment.

abstract = {The most severe complication of influenza is viral pneumonia, which can lead to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Alveolar epithelial cells ({AECs}) are the first cells that influenza virus encounters upon entering the alveolus. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, which in turn induce damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Hepatocyte growth factor ({HGF})/c-Met and transforming growth factor-\alpha ({TGF}-\alpha)/epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) are well known to regulate repair of damaged alveolar epithelium by stimulating cell migration and proliferation. Recently, {TGF}-\alpha/{EGFR} signaling has also been shown to regulate innate immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells. However, little is known about whether {HGF}/c-Met signaling alters the innate immune responses and whether the innate immune responses in {AECs} are regulated by {HGF}/c-Met and {TGF}-\alpha/{EGFR}. We hypothesized that {HGF}/c-Met and {TGF}-\alpha/{EGFR} would regulate innate immune responses to influenza A virus infection in human {AECs}. We found that recombinant human {HGF} ({rhHGF}) and {rhTGF}-\alpha stimulated primary human {AECs} to secrete {IL}-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ({GM}-{CSF}) strongly and {IL}-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 moderately. Influenza infection stimulated the secretion of {IL}-8 and {GM}-{CSF} by {AECs} plated on rat-tail collagen through {EGFR} activation likely by {TGF}-\alpha released from {AECs} and through c-Met activated by {HGF} secreted from lung fibroblasts. {HGF} secretion by fibroblasts was stimulated by {AEC} production of prostaglandin E2 during influenza infection. We conclude that {HGF}/c-Met and {TGF}-\alpha/{EGFR} signaling enhances the innate immune responses by human {AECs} during influenza infections.

However, due to the ability of the {HA} of avian, swine, or human influenza viruses to bind differently linked {SA} and also to the high levels and variability of glycosylations of their major virion glycoprotein components, {HA} and {NA}, {IAV} interacting proteins on the cell surface could also play an important role in initiating different signaling pathways to elicit the immune response in infected cells. But, at present, these processes are not well understood. In this mini-review we discuss how the interactions of {IAV} with cell surface receptors on immune cells might be important for the induction of specific innate immune responses and as a result, for pathogenicity in humans.}

abstract = {Development of anti-influenza A virus ({IAV}) drugs with novel targets and low toxicity is critical for preparedness against influenza outbreaks. In the current study, our results indicated that the novel polyketide compound purpurquinone B ({PPQ}-B) derived from acid-tolerant fungus Penicillium purpurogenum strain {JS03}-21 suppressed the replication of {IAV} in vitro with low toxicity, and may block some stages after virus adsorption. {PPQ}-B could inhibit {H1N1} (A/Puerto Rico/8/34; {PR8}), {H1N1} (A/California/04/2009; Cal09) and {H3N2} (A/swine/Minnesota/02719/2009) virus replication in vitro, suggesting that {PPQ}-B possesses broad-spectrum anti-{IAV} activities. {PPQ}-B's antiviral activity may be largely related to its inhibition of some steps that occur 0-4 h after adsorption. Oral administration of {PPQ}-B could decrease pulmonary viral titers and improve survival rate in {IAV} infected mice. {PPQ}-B also significantly decreased the production of inflammatory factors {TNF}-\alpha, {IL}-6, {RANTES} and {KC} in {IAV} infected lungs and A549 cells, suggesting that {PPQ}-B may also attenuate the inflammatory responses caused by {IAV} infection. {PPQ}-B may down-regulate the {NF}-{\kappaB} and {MAPK} pathways to inhibit both virus replication and inflammatory responses. In summary, {PPQ}-B has the potential to be developed into a novel anti-{IAV} drug targeting host {EGFR} pathway in the future. Copyright \copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

To date, numerous researchers have focused on developing antiviral drugs using natural resources, such as traditional herbal medicines. Poncirus trifoliata is widely used in oriental medicine as a remedy for gastritis, dysentery, inflammation and digestive ulcers. In this study, we investigated the potential antiviral effect of the Poncirus trifoliata orange seed extract against influenza virus. An ethanol extract of Poncirus trifoliata seeds ({PTex}) inhibited the activity of influenza viruses, in particular, oseltamivir- resistant strains, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In contrast to oseltamivir, {PTex} exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the cellular penetration pathway of the virus rather than {HA} receptor binding. The potent antiviral effect and novel working mechanism of {PTex} support its further development as an effective natural antiviral drug with a wide spectrum of activity against influenza and oseltamivir-resistant viruses.}

abstract = {Influenza is a contagion that has plagued mankind for many decades, and continues to pose concerns every year, with millions of infections globally. The frequent mutations and recombination of the influenza A virus ({IAV}) cast a looming threat that antigenically novel strains/subtypes will rise with unpredictable pathogenicity and fear of it evolving into a pandemic strain. There have been four major influenza pandemics, since the beginning of twentieth century, with the great 1918 pandemic being the most severe, killing more than 50 million people worldwide. The mechanisms of {IAV} infection, host immune responses, and how viruses evade from such defensive responses at the molecular and structural levels have been greatly investigated in the past 30 years. While this has advanced our understanding of virus-host interactions and human immunology, and has led to the development of several antiviral drugs, they have minimal impact on the clinical outcomes of infection. The heavy use of these drugs has also imposed selective pressure on {IAV} to evolve and develop resistance. Vaccination remains the cornerstone of public health efforts to protect against influenza; however, rapid mass-production of sufficient vaccines is unlikely to occur immediately after the beginning of a pandemic. This, therefore, requires novel therapeutic strategies against this continually emerging infectious virus with higher specificity and cross-reactivity against multiple strains/subtypes of {IAVs}. This review discusses essential virulence factors of {IAVs} that determine sustainable human-to-human transmission, the mechanisms of viral hijacking of host cells and subversion of host innate immune responses, and novel therapeutic interventions that demonstrate promising antiviral properties against {IAV}. This hopefully will promote discussions and investigations on novel avenues of prevention and treatment strategies of influenza, that are effective and cross-protective against multiple strains/subtypes of {IAV}, in preparation for the advent of future {IAVs} and pandemics.}

abstract = {Airway mucin overproduction is the hallmark risk factor of asthma, which is associated with the reduction of lung function. An aberrant mucin expression is responsible for airway obstruction due to its high viscous characteristics. Among the mucins discovered, {MUC5AC} is the prime mucin of airway epithelia. Nowadays, mucins induced asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) are a great concern all over the world. This review focuses on the effects of natural compounds that can be beneficial to explore new drugs to halt {MUC5AC} secretion and production in airway epithelial, and also their underlying molecular mechanisms based on recent studies. Several researchers are seeking natural sources to identify a new potent {MUC5AC} inhibitory agent for clinical applications, because of countable limitations of existing synthetic drugs. Currently, flavonoids, glycoside and steroids like natural compounds have acquired great attention due to their anti-inflammatory and mucoregulatory effects. Most importantly, many natural compounds have shown their potential effects as the modulator of mucin expression, secretion, and production. Therefore, targeting airway {MUC5AC} expression and production represents an auspicious area of research for the development of drugs against various respiratory diseases.

Data-driven causal inference is challenging since datasets are often high-dimensional and nonlinear with limited sample sizes. Here we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm that allows to reconstruct causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on a well-established climatic teleconnection connecting the tropical Pacific with extra-tropical temperatures and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative techniques in detection power from small to large-scale datasets and opens up entirely new possibilities to discover causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.}

Through interviews with domain experts, we identified four common tasks that require an understanding of the causality within pathways, that is, the downstream and upstream relationships between proteins and biochemical reactions, including: visualizing downstream consequences of perturbing a protein; finding the shortest path between two proteins; detecting feedback loops within the pathway; and identifying common downstream elements from two or more proteins. {RESULTS}: We introduce {ReactionFlow}, a visual analytics application for pathway analysis that emphasizes the structural and causal relationships amongst proteins, complexes, and biochemical reactions within a given pathway. To support the identified causality analysis tasks, user interactions allow an analyst to filter, cluster, and select pathway components across linked views. Animation is used to highlight the flow of activity through a pathway. {CONCLUSIONS}: We evaluated {ReactionFlow} by providing our application to two domain experts who have significant experience with biomolecular pathways, after which we conducted a series of in-depth interviews focused on each of the four causality analysis tasks. Their feedback leads us to believe that our techniques could be useful to researchers who must be able to understand and analyze the complex nature of biological pathways. {ReactionFlow} is available at https://github.com/{CreativeCodingLab}/{ReactionFlow}.}

The network structure changes from the significance of biological experiments and layout algorithms often sacrifice low-level details to maintain high-level information, which complicates the entire image to large biochemical systems such as human metabolic pathways. {RESULTS}: Our work is inspired by concepts from urban planning since we create a visual hierarchy of biological pathways, which is analogous to city blocks and grid-like road networks in an urban area. We automatize the manual drawing process of biologists by first partitioning the map domain into multiple sub-blocks, and then building the corresponding pathways by routing edges schematically, to maintain the global and local context simultaneously. Our system incorporates constrained floor-planning and network-flow algorithms to optimize the layout of sub-blocks and to distribute the edge density along the map domain. We have developed the approach in close collaboration with domain experts and present their feedback on the pathway diagrams based on selected use cases. {CONCLUSIONS}: We present a new approach for computing biological pathway maps that untangles visual clutter by decomposing large networks into semantic sub-networks and bundling long edges to create space for presenting relationships systematically.}

The Grassmann manifold provides a robust framework for measuring data similarity in a subspace context. Sparse radial basis function classification as a visualization technique leverages recent advances in radial basis function learning via convex optimization. In the spirit of deep belief networks, supervised centroid-encoding is proposed as a way to exploit class label information. These methods are compared to linear and nonlinear principal component analysis (autoencoders) in the context of data visualization; these approaches may perform poorly for visualization when the variance of the data is spread across more than three dimensions. In contrast, the proposed methods are shown to capture significant data structure in two or three dimensions, even when the information in the data lives in higher dimensional subspaces. To illustrate these ideas, the visualization techniques are applied to gene expression data sets that capture the host immune system's response to infection by the Ebola virus in non-human primate and collaborative cross mouse.

abstract = {{PI3k}-Akt and p53 pathways are known to play anti- and pro-apoptotic roles in cell death, respectively. Whether these pathways are recruited in influenza virus infection in highly productive monkey ({CV}-1) and canine ({MDCK}) kidney cells was studied here. Phosphorylation of Akt (Akt-pho) was found to occur only early after infection (5-9 h.p.i). Nuclear accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 (p53-pho), and expression of its natural target p21/waf showed low constitutive levels at this period, whereas all three parameters were markedly elevated at the late apoptotic stage (17-20 h.p.i.). Up-regulation of Akt-pho and p53-pho was not induced by {UV}-inactivated virus suggesting that it required virus replication. Also, {mRNAs} of p53 and its natural antagonist mdm2 were not increased throughout infection indicating that p53-pho was up-regulated by posttranslational mechanisms. However, p53 activation did not seem to play a leading role in influenza-induced cell death: (i) infection of {CV1} and {MDCK} cells with recombinant {NS1}-deficient virus provoked accelerated apoptotic death characterized by the lack of p53 activation; (ii) mixed apoptosis-necrosis death developed in influenza-infected human bronchial H1299 cells carrying a tetracycline-regulated p53 gene did not depend on p53 gene activation by tetracycline. Virus-induced apoptosis and signaling of Akt and p53 developed in {IFN}-deficient {VERO} cells with similar kinetics as in {IFN}-competent {CV1}-infected cells indicating that these processes were endocrine {IFN}-independent. Apoptosis in influenza-infected {CV}-1 and {MDCK} cells was Akt-dependent and was accelerated by Ly294002, a specific inhibitor of {PI3k}-Akt signaling, and down-regulated by the viral protein {NS1}, an inducer of host Akt. The obtained data suggest that influenza virus (i) initiates anti-apoptotic {PI3k}-Akt signaling at early and middle phases of infection to protect cells from fast apoptotic death and (ii) provokes both p53-dependent and alternative p53-independent apoptotic and/or necrotic (in some host systems) cell death at the late stage of infection.}

abstract = {Influenza A viruses ({IAVs}) are respiratory pathogens that cause severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. They affect cellular processes such as proliferation, protein synthesis, autophagy, and apoptosis. Although apoptosis is considered an innate cellular response to invading infectious pathogens, {IAVs} have evolved to encode viral proteins that modulate host cellular apoptosis in ways that support efficient viral replication and propagation. An understanding of the modulation of host responses is essential to the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of {IAV} infections. In this review, we discuss the {IAV} lifecycle, biology, and strategies employed by the virus to modulate apoptosis to enhance viral survival and establish an infection.}

They either assist persistent viral infection or elicit the elimination of infected cells by the host. Death receptor-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in viral pathogenesis and the host antiviral response. Many viruses have acquired the capability to subvert death receptor-mediated apoptosis and evade the host immune response, mainly by virally encoded gene products that suppress death receptor-mediated apoptosis. In this review, we summarize the current information on virus infection and death receptor-mediated apoptosis, particularly focusing on the viral proteins that modulate death receptor-mediated apoptosis.}

Further, we sought to support the development of metabolic flux models from pathway databases, and to use pathway information to leverage the interpretation of high-throughput data sets. {RESULTS}: In the past 4 years we have enhanced the already extensive Pathway Tools software in several respects. It can now support metabolic-model execution through the Web, it provides a more accurate gap filler for metabolic models; it supports development of models for organism communities distributed across a spatial grid; and model results may be visualized graphically. Pathway Tools supports several new omics-data analysis tools including the Omics Dashboard, multi-pathway diagrams called pathway collages, a pathway-covering algorithm for metabolomics data analysis and an algorithm for generating mechanistic explanations of multi-omics data. We have also improved the core pathway/genome databases management capabilities of the software, providing new multi-organism search tools for organism communities, improved graphics rendering, faster performance and re-designed gene and metabolite pages. {AVAILABILITY}: The software is free for academic use; a fee is required for commercial use.

However, there are currently only two classes of antivirals approved for use against influenza, limiting the possible combinations that can be considered for treatment. However, new antivirals are being developed that target different parts of the viral replication cycle, and their potential for use in combination therapy should be considered. The role of antiviral mechanism of action in the effectiveness of combination therapy has not yet been systematically investigated to determine whether certain antiviral mechanisms of action pair well in combination. Here, we use a mathematical model of influenza to model combination treatment with antivirals having different mechanisms of action to measure peak viral load, infection duration, and synergy of different drug combinations. We find that antivirals that lower the infection rate and antivirals that increase the duration of the eclipse phase perform poorly in combination with other antivirals.}

In this second analysis, we examined the effects of {NAI} treatment on antibody responses and virus clearance, and the relationships between antibody responses and patients' infection histories (previous infection; asymptomatic infection via household members of same virus type/subtype; vaccination), and between infection histories and viral kinetics. Haemagglutination inhibition ({HI}) antibody responses produced {HI} titres ≥40 by Day 14 of {NAI} treatment, in parallel with virus clearance (trend test P = 0.001). Comparing patients with and without influenza infection histories (directly or asymptomatic infection via household members) showed that infection history had a marked positive effect on {HI} antibody responses in patients vaccinated before the current influenza season (before enrolment). Current virus clearance was significantly faster in patients previously infected with the same virus type/subtype than in those not previously infected, and clearance pattern depended on the {NAI}.

abstract = {Influenza A viruses ({IAVs}) remain serious threats to public health because of the shortage of effective means of control. Developing more effective virus control modalities requires better understanding of virus-host interactions. It has previously been shown that {IAV} induces the production of kynurenine, which suppresses T-cell responses, enhances pain hypersensitivity and disturbs behaviour in infected animals. However, the regulation of kynurenine biosynthesis during {IAV} infection remains elusive. Here we showed that {IAV} infection induced expression of interferons ({IFNs}), which upregulated production of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase ({IDO1}), which catalysed the kynurenine biosynthesis. Furthermore, {IAV} attenuated the {IDO1} expression and the production of kynurenine through its {NS1} protein. Interestingly, inhibition of viral replication prior to {IFN} induction limited {IDO1} expression, while inhibition after did not. Finally, we showed that kynurenine biosynthesis was activated in macrophages in response to other stimuli, such as influenza B virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Thus, the tight regulation of the kynurenine biosynthesis by host cell and, perhaps, pathogen might be a basic signature of a wide range of host-pathogen interactions, which should be taken into account during development of novel antiviral and antibacterial drugs. \copyright 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.}

Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signaling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of virus-host interactions and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.

abstract = {Influenza A viruses ({IAV}) are commonly used to infect animal cell cultures for research purposes and vaccine production. Their replication is influenced strongly by the multiplicity of infection ({MOI}), which ranges over several orders of magnitude depending on the respective application. So far, mathematical models of {IAV} replication have paid little attention to the impact of the {MOI} on infection dynamics and virus yields. To address this issue, we extended an existing model of {IAV} replication in adherent {MDCK} cells with kinetics that explicitly consider the time point of cell infection. This modification does not only enable the fitting of high {MOI} measurements, but also the successful prediction of viral release dynamics of low {MOI} experiments using the same set of parameters. Furthermore, this model allows the investigation of defective interfering particle ({DIP}) propagation in different {MOI} regimes. The key difference between high and low {MOI} conditions is the percentage of infectious virions among the total virus particle release. Simulation studies show that {DIP} interference at a high {MOI} is determined exclusively by the {DIP} content of the seed virus while, in low {MOI} conditions, it is predominantly controlled by the de novo generation of {DIPs}. Overall, the extended model provides an ideal framework for the prediction and optimization of cell culture-derived {IAV} manufacturing and the production of {DIPs} for therapeutic use.}

The suite consists of three independent models that represent (1) cilium assembly, (2) ciliary beating, and (3) goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia and that were built in the Biological Expression Language, which is both human-readable and computable. The network analysis of highly connected nodes and pathways demonstrated that the relevant biology was captured in the {MCC} models. We also show the scoring of transcriptomic data onto these network models and demonstrate that the models capture the perturbation in each dataset accurately. This work is a continuation of our approach to use computational biological network models and mathematical algorithms that allow for the interpretation of high-throughput molecular datasets in the context of known biology.

Biological knowledge and knowledge about standardized terminologies are difficult to capture from literature in a usable form. A semi-automated knowledge extraction workflow is presented that was developed to allow users to extract causal and correlative relationships from scientific literature and to transcribe them into the computable and human readable Biological Expression Language ({BEL}). The workflow combines state-of-the-art linguistic tools for recognition of various entities and extraction of knowledge from literature sources. Unlike most other approaches, the workflow outputs the results to a curation interface for manual curation and converts them into {BEL} documents that can be compiled to form biological networks. We developed a new semi-automated knowledge extraction workflow that was designed to capture and organize scientific knowledge and reduce the required curation skills and effort for this task. The workflow was used to build a network that represents the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization in an apolipoprotein-E-deficient ({ApoE}(-/-)) mouse model. The network was generated using knowledge extracted from the primary literature. The resultant atherosclerotic plaque destabilization network contains 304 nodes and 743 edges supported by 33 {PubMed} referenced articles. A comparison between the semi-automated and conventional curation processes showed similar results, but significantly reduced curation effort for the semi-automated process. Creating structured knowledge from unstructured text is an important step for the mechanistic interpretation and reusability of knowledge. Our new semi-automated knowledge extraction workflow reduced the curation skills and effort required to capture and organize scientific knowledge. The atherosclerotic plaque destabilization network that was generated is a causal network model for vascular disease demonstrating the usefulness of the workflow for knowledge extraction and construction of mechanistically meaningful biological networks. \copyright The Author(s) 2015.

We selected a subset of these resources focusing on a reduced set of namespaces, namely, human and mouse genes, {ChEBI} chemicals, {MeSH} diseases and {GO} biological processes, as well as relationship types 'increases' and 'decreases'. The published training corpus contains 11 000 {BEL} statements from over 6000 supportive text excerpts. For method evaluation, we selected and re-annotated two smaller subcorpora containing 100 text excerpts. For this re-annotation, the inter-annotator agreement was measured by the {BEL} track evaluation environment and resulted in a maximal F-score of 91.18\% for full statement agreement. In addition, for a set of 100 {BEL} statements, we do not only provide the gold standard expert annotations, but also text excerpts pre-selected by two automated systems. Those text excerpts were evaluated and manually annotated as true or false supportive in the course of the {BioCreative} V {BEL} track task.Database {URL}: http://wiki.openbel.org/display/{BIOC}/Datasets. \copyright The Author(s) 2016.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although several experimental therapeutics for Ebola virus disease ({EVD}) have been developed, the safety and efficacy of the most promising therapies need to be assessed in the context of a randomized, controlled trial. {METHODS}: We conducted a trial of four investigational therapies for {EVD} in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where an outbreak began in August 2018. Patients of any age who had a positive result for Ebola virus {RNA} on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were enrolled. All patients received standard care and were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to intravenous administration of the triple monoclonal antibody {ZMapp} (the control group), the antiviral agent remdesivir, the single monoclonal antibody {MAb114}, or the triple monoclonal antibody {REGN}-{EB3}. The {REGN}-{EB3} group was added in a later version of the protocol, so data from these patients were compared with those of patients in the {ZMapp} group who were enrolled at or after the time the {REGN}-{EB3} group was added (the {ZMapp} subgroup). The primary end point was death at 28 days. {RESULTS}: A total of 681 patients were enrolled from November 20, 2018, to August 9, 2019, at which time the data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients be assigned only to the {MAb114} and {REGN}-{EB3} groups for the remainder of the trial; the recommendation was based on the results of an interim analysis that showed superiority of these groups to {ZMapp} and remdesivir with respect to mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 61 of 174 patients (35.1\%) in the {MAb114} group, as compared with 84 of 169 (49.7\%) in the {ZMapp} group (P = 0.007), and in 52 of 155 (33.5\%) in the {REGN}-{EB3} group, as compared with 79 of 154 (51.3\%) in the {ZMapp} subgroup (P = 0.002). A shorter duration of symptoms before admission and lower baseline values for viral load and for serum creatinine and aminotransferase levels each correlated with improved survival. Four serious adverse events were judged to be potentially related to the trial drugs. {CONCLUSIONS}: Both {MAb114} and {REGN}-{EB3} were superior to {ZMapp} in reducing mortality from {EVD}. Scientifically and ethically sound clinical research can be conducted during disease outbreaks and can help inform the outbreak response.

It provides functionality for representing complex relationships between words and word phrases that are not available in other software tools, including the ability to define and visualize relationships between the relationships themselves (semantic hypergraphs). Additionally, we include an approach to representing text annotations in which annotation subgraphs, or semantic summaries, are used to show relationships outside of the sequential context of the text itself. Users can use these subgraphs to quickly find similar structures within the current document or external annotated documents. Initially, {TAG} was developed to support information extraction tasks on a large database of biomedical articles. However, our software is flexible enough to support a wide range of annotation tasks for any domain. Examples are provided that showcase {TAG}'s capabilities on morphological parsing and event extraction tasks.

As the ground truth for assessing accuracy, we use synthetic networks with predictable trajectories, literature-curated Boolean models and diverse transcriptional regulatory networks. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell transcriptional data from synthetic and Boolean networks that avoids pitfalls of previously used methods. Furthermore, we collect networks from multiple experimental single-cell {RNA}-seq datasets. We develop an evaluation framework called {BEELINE}. We find that the area under the precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate. Based on these results, we present recommendations to end users. {BEELINE} will aid the development of gene regulatory network inference algorithms.}

Interestingly, a viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme ({ACE})-2, was down-regulated in persistently infected cells. G418-selected clones established from parent Vero E6 cells, which were transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene, were infected with {SARS}-{CoV}, resulting in a potential cell population capable of persistence in Vero E6 cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that signaling pathways of extracellular signal-related kinase ({ERK1}/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase ({JNK}), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}), and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase ({PI3K})/Akt were activated in {SARS}-{CoV}-infected Vero E6 cells. Previous studies also showed that the activation of p38 {MAPK} by viral infection-induced apoptosis, and a weak activation of Akt was not sufficient to protect from apoptosis. In the present study, we showed that the inhibitors of {JNK} and {PI3K}/Akt inhibited the establishment of persistence, but those of {MAPK}/{ERK} kinase ({MEK}; as an inhibitor for {ERK1}/2) and p38 {MAPK} did not. These results indicated that two signaling pathways of {JNK} and {PI3K}/Akt were important for the establishment of persistence in Vero E6 cells.}

This approach has been applied to a wide variety of contexts, from health to economics [4, 7]. Variable interventions have long been studied in independent and identically distributed (iid) data contexts, but recently non-iid settings, such as networks with interacting agents [9, 20, 32] have attracted interest. In this paper, we propose a type of structural intervention [14] relevant in network contexts: the network intervention. Rather than estimating the effect of changing variables, we consider changes to social network structure resulting from creation or severance of ties between agents. We define the individual participant and average bystander effects for these interventions and describe identification criteria. We then prove a series of theoretical results that show existing identification theory obtains minimally {KL}-divergent distributions corresponding to network interventions. Finally, we demonstrate estimation of effects of network interventions via a simulation study.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Coronaviruses ({CoVs}) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}) has demonstrated the lethality of {CoVs} when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human {CoVs} and since then much progress has been made in understanding the {CoV} life cycle. The {CoV} envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other {CoV} proteins and host cell proteins. {MAIN} {BODY}: This review aims to establish the current knowledge on {CoV} E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge. It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings. Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research. {CONCLUSIONS}: The most progress has been made on {SARS}-{CoV} E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the {CoV} life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis. Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that {CoVs} lacking E make promising vaccine candidates. The high mortality rate of certain {CoVs}, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into {CoV} molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human {CoVs} and enzootic {CoVs}.}

As the intracellular {NADH}:{NAD}+ ratio can be in near equilibrium with the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, we hypothesized that reductive stress could be alleviated by oxidizing extracellular lactate to pyruvate. We engineered {LOXCAT}, a fusion of bacterial lactate oxidase ({LOX}) and catalase ({CAT}), which irreversibly converts lactate and oxygen to pyruvate and water. Addition of purified {LOXCAT} to the medium of cultured human cells with a defective electron transport chain decreased the extracellular lactate:pyruvate ratio, normalized the intracellular {NADH}:{NAD}+ ratio, upregulated glycolytic {ATP} production and restored cellular proliferation. In mice, tail-vein-injected {LOXCAT} lowered the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, blunted a metformin-induced rise in blood lactate:pyruvate ratio and improved {NADH}:{NAD}+ balance in the heart and brain. Our study lays the groundwork for a class of injectable therapeutic enzymes that alleviates intracellular redox imbalances by directly targeting circulating redox-coupled metabolites.}

The epitopes and mechanisms of {mAbs} targeting non-{RBD} regions have not been well characterized yet. Here we report the monoclonal antibody {7D10} that binds to the N-terminal domain ({NTD}) of the spike glycoprotein and inhibits the cell entry of {MERS}-{CoV} with high potency. Structure determination and mutagenesis experiments reveal the epitope and critical residues on the {NTD} for {7D10} binding and neutralization. Further experiments indicate that the neutralization by {7D10} is not solely dependent on the inhibition of {DPP4} binding, but also acts after viral cell attachment, inhibiting the pre-fusion to post-fusion conformational change of the spike. These properties give {7D10} a wide neutralization breadth and help explain its synergistic effects with several {RBD}-targeting antibodies.}

Previous studies indicated that some of those bat {SARSr}-{CoVs} have the potential to infect humans. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel coronavirus ({nCoV}-2019) which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratory confirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of the outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5\% sequence identify to {SARS}-{CoV}. Furthermore, it was found that {nCoV}-2019 is 96\% identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of {SARSr}-{CoV}. The {nCoV}-2019 virus was then isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can be neutralized by sera from several patients. Importantly, we have confirmed that this novel {CoV} uses the same cell entry receptor, {ACE2}, as {SARS}-{CoV}.}

Since {SARS}-{CoV} was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as {SARS}-{CoV} and the recent 2019-{nCoV}, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human {ACE2} is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-{nCoV}.}

Recently, it became obvious that these cytokines have a multitude of additional functions. Due to the unique features of the chickens' immune system, available data from mouse models are not easily transferable; hence we performed an extensive analysis of chicken {IRGs}. {RESULTS}: A broad database search for homologues to described mammalian {IRGs} (common {IRGs}, {cIRGs}) was combined with a transcriptome analysis of spleen and lung at different time points after application of {IFN\alpha}. To apply physiological amounts of {IFN}, half-life of {IFN} in the chicken was determined. Interestingly, the calculated 36 min are considerably shorter than the ones obtained for human and mouse. Microarray analysis revealed many additional {IRGs} (newly identified {IRGs}; {nIRGs}) and network analysis for selected {IRGs} showed a broad interaction of {nIRGs} among each other and with {cIRGs}. We found that {IRGs} exhibit a highly tissue and time specific expression pattern as expression quality and quantity differed strongly between spleen and lung and over time. While in the spleen for many affected genes changes in {RNA} abundance peaked already after 3 h, an increasing or plateau-like regulation after 3, 6 and 9 h was observed in the lung. {CONCLUSIONS}: The induction or suppression of {IRGs} in chickens is both tissue and time specific and beside known antiviral mechanisms type I {IFN} induces many additional cellular functions. We confirmed many known {IRGs} and established a multitude of so far undescribed ones, thus providing a large database for future research on antiviral mechanisms and additional {IFN} functions in non-mammalian species.}

abstract = {In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}) is thought to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan, China. The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R\_0) to be 3.8 (95\% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75\% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1\% (95\%{CI}, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99\% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9\% on 4 February. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-{nCoV} outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. {METHODS}: All patients with suspected 2019-{nCoV} were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-{nCoV} infection by real-time {RT}-{PCR} and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by {WHO} and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit ({ICU}) and those who had not. {FINDINGS}: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-{nCoV} infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73\%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32\%]), including diabetes (eight [20\%]), hypertension (six [15\%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15\%]). Median age was 49·0 years ({IQR} 41·0-58·0). 27 (66\%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98\%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76\%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44\%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28\%] of 39), headache (three [8\%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5\%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3\%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55\%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [{IQR} 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63\%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest {CT}. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29\%]), {RNAaemia} (six [15\%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12\%]) and secondary infection (four [10\%]). 13 (32\%) patients were admitted to an {ICU} and six (15\%) died. Compared with non-{ICU} patients, {ICU} patients had higher plasma levels of {IL2}, {IL7}, {IL10}, {GSCF}, {IP10}, {MCP1}, {MIP1A}, and {TNF\alpha}. {INTERPRETATION}: The 2019-{nCoV} infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with {ICU} admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies. {FUNDING}: Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.

abstract = {The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}) has caused more than 800 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 25 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain ({RBD}) in 2019-{nCoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-{SARS}-{CoV} antibodies with 2019-{nCoV} spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-{nCoV}. Here, we report for the first time that a {SARS}-{CoV}-specific human monoclonal antibody, {CR3022}, could bind potently with 2019-{nCoV} {RBD} ({KD} of 6.3 {nM}). The epitope of {CR3022} does not overlap with the {ACE2} binding site within 2019-{nCoV} {RBD}. Therefore, {CR3022} has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-{nCoV} infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent {SARS}-{CoV}-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, {CR3014}) that target the {ACE2} binding site of {SARS}-{CoV} failed to bind 2019-{nCoV} spike protein, indicating that the difference in the {RBD} of {SARS}-{CoV} and 2019-{nCoV} has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-{nCoV} {RBD}.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-{nCoV} infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. {METHODS}: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-{nCoV} genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of {cDNA} ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-{nCoV} genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. {FINDINGS}: The ten genome sequences of 2019-{nCoV} obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98\% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-{nCoV} was closely related (with 88\% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS})-like coronaviruses, bat-{SL}-{CoVZC45} and bat-{SL}-{CoVZXC21}, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from {SARS}-{CoV} (about 79\%) and {MERS}-{CoV} (about 50\%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-{nCoV} fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-{SL}-{CoVZC45} and bat-{SL}-{CoVZXC21}, and was genetically distinct from {SARS}-{CoV}. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-{nCoV} had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of {SARS}-{CoV}, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. {INTERPRETATION}: 2019-{nCoV} is sufficiently divergent from {SARS}-{CoV} to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-{nCoV} might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation. {FUNDING}: National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.

Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-{nCoV} infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-{nCoV} has 89\% nucleotide identity with bat {SARS}-like-{CoVZXC21} and 82\% with that of human {SARS}-{CoV}. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human {SARS} coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-{nCoV} shares only 40\% amino acid identity with other {SARS}-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in {SARS} and camel in {MERS}, hunting for the animal source of 2019-{nCoV} and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.}

Following intranasal administration, the virus replicated in the lungs, with peak titers on day 2 postinfection. Enhanced production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [{TNF}-alpha] and interleukin-6 [{IL}-6]) and chemokines ({CXCL10}, {CCL2}, {CCL3}, and {CCL5}) correlated with migration of {NK} cells, macrophages, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ({pDC}) into the lungs. By day 7, histopathologic evidence of pneumonitis was seen in the lungs when viral clearance occurred. At this time, a second wave of enhanced production of cytokines ({TNF}-alpha, {IL}-6, gamma interferon [{IFN}-gamma], {IL}-2, and {IL}-5), chemokines ({CXCL9}, {CXCL10}, {CCL2}, {CCL3}, and {CCL5}), and receptors ({CXCR3}, {CCR2}, and {CCR5}), was detected in the lungs, associated with an influx of T lymphocytes. Depletion of {CD8}(+) T cells at the time of infection did not affect viral replication or clearance. However, depletion of {CD4}(+) T cells resulted in an enhanced immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of {SARS}-{CoV} from the lungs, which was associated with reduced neutralizing antibody and cytokine production and reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes. Innate defense mechanisms are able to control {SARS}-{CoV} infection in the absence of {CD4}(+) and {CD8}(+) T cells and antibodies. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of {SARS}, demonstrating the important role of {CD4}(+) but not {CD8}(+) T cells in primary {SARS}-{CoV} infection in this model.}

abstract = {Novel Coronavirus ({nCoV}) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense {RNA} genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-{nCoV} genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This {nCoV} genotype might have been evolved from a bat-{CoV} by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-{nCoV} during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-{nCoV} Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide (5\textquoteright-{aAT} {GGT} {GTT} {GAA} {GGT} {TTT} {AAT} {TGT} {TAC} {TTT} {CCT} {TTA} {CAA} Tca-3\textquoteright) sequence insertion, which shares homology to fish genomic sequence of Myripristis murdjan , an abundant fish type in Indo-Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity ({HBA}) {CD4} T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by {HLA}-{DR} alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit {CoV} vaccine. Diverse {HLA} types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of {CoV} strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic {CoV} strains.}

Despite intense research effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12nd 2019. Epidemiological investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}) suggested that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ({BALF}) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 26th 2019. Next generation metagenomic {RNA} sequencing4 identified a novel {RNA} virus from the family Coronaviridae designed {WH}-Human-1 coronavirus ({WHCV}). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that {WHCV} was most closely related (89.1\% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ({SARS})-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Chronic pancreatitis ({CP}) is a progressive, fibro-inflammatory disease characterized by enzymatic autoactivation and subsequent fibrotic replacement of acinar cells. A significant proportion of patients develop pain, which may be due to many causes, including perineural inflammation, altered central processing of pain signals, parenchymal structural changes, and ductal obstruction. Currently there are no approved medical treatment options for {CP}-associated pain. {NI}-03 (camostat mesilate) is an orally administered serine protease inhibitor that reduces pancreatic enzyme activity and has been widely used for the treatment of {CP}-associated pain in Japan. The current study will assess the safety and efficacy of {NI}-03 for reduction of {CP}-associated pain in the {USA}. {METHODS}: The current study consists of two phases. First, a phase I study will be performed to establish the pharmacokinetics and safety profile over a 1-week period following a single dose (100, 200, or 300 mg). Subsequently, a phase {II} study will be performed consisting of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial ({RCT}). This {RCT} will evaluate the efficacy of each of the three doses of {NI}-03 given three times daily compared to placebo over 28 days. A 7-day, single-blind, run-in period will precede the double-blind phase to assess baseline pain characteristics. The primary efficacy outcome is the average of worst daily pain scores (numeric rating scale of 0-10) over the terminal 7 days of the study period compared to baseline. Secondary efficacy outcomes include change in opioid dose and quality of life measures, and time to first rescue intravenous analgesic. Adverse events will be recorded. {DISCU\SSION}: {NI}-03 has been used successfully and safely in Japan to treat {CP}-associated pain. The aim of the current study is to assess the safety and efficacy of {NI}-03 using a rigorous {RCT} in a population in the {USA}. This study may fill an important clinical gap to provide an effective medical treatment option for {CP}-associated pain. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT02693093} .

In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human {ACE2} to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin {IgG1}. An {ACE2} mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) of {SARS}-{CoV} and 2019-{nCoV} and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized {SARS}-{CoV} and 2019-{nCoV} in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-{nCoV}.}

The latter membrane fusion requires an S protein conformational flexibility that is facilitated by proteolytic cleavages. We hypothesized that the most relevant cellular proteases in this process are those closely linked to host cell receptors. The primary receptor for the human severe acute respiratory syndrome {CoV} ({SARS}) {CoV} is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}). {ACE2} immunoprecipitation captured transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 ({TMPR\SS2}), a known human airway and alveolar protease. {ACE2} and {TMPR\SS2} colocalized on cell surfaces and enhanced the cell entry of both {SARS} S-pseudotyped {HIV} and authentic {SARS}-{CoV}. Enhanced entry correlated with {TMPR\SS2}-mediated proteolysis of both S and {ACE2}.

In this study, we demonstrated that {SARS}-{CoV} inactivated by beta-propiolactone elicited high titers of antibodies in the immunized mice and rabbits that recognize the spike (S) protein, especially the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) in the S1 region. The antisera from the immunized animals efficiently bound to the {RBD} and blocked binding of {RBD} to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the functional receptor on the susceptible cells for {SARS}-{CoV}. With a sensitive and quantitative single-cycle infection assay using pseudovirus bearing the {SARS}-{CoV} S protein, we demonstrated that mouse and rabbit antisera significantly inhibited S protein-mediated virus entry with mean 50\% inhibitory titers of 1:7393 and 1:2060, respectively. These data suggest that the {RBD} of S protein is a major neutralization determinant in the inactivated {SARS} vaccine which can induce potent neutralizing antibodies to block {SARS}-{CoV} entry. However, caution should be taken in using the inactivated {SARS}-{CoV} as a vaccine since it may also cause harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses.}

abstract = {Public health measures successfully contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) infection. However, the precursor of the {SARS}-{CoV} remains in its natural bat reservoir, and reemergence of a human-adapted {SARS}-like coronavirus remains a plausible public health concern. Vaccination is a major strategy for containing resurgence of {SARS} in humans, and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models. We previously reported that antibody elicited by a {SARS}-{CoV} vaccine candidate based on recombinant full-length Spike-protein trimers potentiated infection of human B cell lines despite eliciting in vivo a neutralizing and protective immune response in rodents. These observations prompted us to investigate the mechanisms underlying antibody-dependent enhancement ({ADE}) of {SARS}-{CoV} infection in vitro. We demonstrate here that anti-Spike immune serum, while inhibiting viral entry in a permissive cell line, potentiated infection of immune cells by {SARS}-{CoV} Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles, as well as replication-competent {SARS} coronavirus. Antibody-mediated infection was dependent on Fc\gamma receptor {II} but did not use the endosomal/lysosomal pathway utilized by angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), the accepted receptor for {SARS}-{CoV}. This suggests that {ADE} of {SARS}-{CoV} utilizes a novel cell entry mechanism into immune cells. Different {SARS} vaccine candidates elicit sera that differ in their capacity to induce {ADE} in immune cells despite their comparable potency to neutralize infection in {ACE2}-bearing cells. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which {SARS}-{CoV} can enter target cells and illustrate the potential pitfalls associated with immunization against it. These findings should prompt further investigations into {SARS} pathogenesis.}

Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-{nCoV} {ARD} from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90\% were females. Only 1.18\% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30\% had been to Wuhan and 71.80\% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9\%) and cough (67.7\%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00\%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87\% vs. 5.20\%, P\textless0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1\% of patients. 55 patients (5.00\%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36\%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95\% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-{nCoV} epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-{nCoV} infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/{CT} manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.}

Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of {MERS}-{CoV} infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented {MERS}-{CoV}-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited {MERS}-{CoV} replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a {MERS} clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-{nCoV}.}

The complete genome of the {SARS}-{CoV} ({SARS} coronavirus) has since been sequenced. The {SARS}-{CoV} nucleocapsid ({SARS}-{CoV} N) protein shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. In the present paper, we show that {SARS}-{CoV} N is capable of inducing apoptosis of {COS}-1 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors by down-regulating {ERK} (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), up-regulating {JNK} (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 {MAPK} (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways, and affecting their downstream effectors. {SARS}-{CoV} N expression also down-regulated phospho-Akt and Bcl-2 levels, and activated caspases 3 and 7. However, apoptosis was independent of the p53 and Fas signalling pathways. Furthermore, activation of the p38 {MAPK} pathway was found to induce actin reorganization in cells devoid of growth factors. At the cytoskeletal level, {SARS}-{CoV} N down-regulated {FAK} (focal adhesion kinase) activity and also down-regulated fibronectin expression. This is the first report showing the ability of the N protein of {SARS}-{CoV} to induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stressed conditions.}

abstract = {Over the last decades, yeast has become a key model organism for the study of lipid biochemistry. Because the regulation of lipids has been closely linked to various physiopathologies, the study of these biomolecules could lead to new diagnostics and treatments. Before the field can reach this point, however, sufficient tools for integrating and analyzing the ever-growing availability of lipidomics data will need to be developed. To this end, genome-scale models ({GEMs}) of metabolic networks are useful tools, though their large size and complexity introduces too much uncertainty in the accuracy of predicted outcomes. Ideally, therefore, a model for studying lipids would contain only the pathways required for the proper analysis of these biomolecules, but would not be an ad hoc reduction. We hereby present a metabolic model that focuses on lipid metabolism constructed through the integration of detailed lipid pathways into an already existing {GEM} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our model was then systematically reduced around the subsystems defined by these pathways to provide a more manageable model size for complex studies. We show that this model is as consistent and inclusive as other yeast {GEMs} regarding the focus and detail on the lipid metabolism, and can be used as a scaffold for integrating lipidomics data to improve predictions in studies of lipid-related biological functions. \copyright {FEMS} 2020.}

Currently used protective measures pose potential risk of primary/secondary infection and transmission. Here, we report the development of a universal, reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the main fibrous filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium chloride salt. The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer, and 100\% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh environmental conditions. Our results can be applied in obtaining a broad-spectrum, airborne pathogen prevention device in preparation for epidemic and pandemic of respiratory diseases.}

We confirm high sequence similarity (\textgreater99\%) between all sequenced 2019-{nCoVs} genomes available, with the closest {BCoV} sequence sharing 96.2\% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-{nCoV}. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-{nCoV} genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral {ORF8}-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches. \copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

Switching from thin tailed to fat tailed distributions requires more than "changing the color of the dress". Traditional asymptotics deal mainly with either n=1 or n=\textbackslashinftyn=\textbackslashinfty, and the real world is in between, under of the "laws of the medium numbers" --which vary widely across specific distributions. Both the law of large numbers and the generalized central limit mechanisms operate in highly idiosyncratic ways outside the standard Gaussian or Levy-Stable basins of convergence. A few examples: + The sample mean is rarely in line with the population mean, with effect on "naive empiricism", but can be sometimes be estimated via parametric methods. + The "empirical distribution" is rarely empirical. + Parameter uncertainty has compounding effects on statistical metrics. + Dimension reduction (principal components) fails. + Inequality estimators ({GINI} or quantile contributions) are not additive and produce wrong results. + Many "biases" found in psychology become entirely rational under more sophisticated probability distributions + Most of the failures of financial economics, econometrics, and behavioral economics can be attributed to using the wrong distributions.

abstract = {Evolving ecosystems often are dominated by spatially local dynamics, but many also include long-range transport that mixes spatially separated groups. The existence of such mixing may be of critical importance since research shows spatial separation may be responsible for long-term stability of predator-prey systems. Complete mixing results in rapid global extinction, while spatial systems achive long term stability due to an inhomogeneous spatial pattern of local extinctions. We consider the robustness of a generic evolving predator-prey or host-pathogen model to long-range mixing and find a transition to global extinction at nontrivial values implying that even if significant mixing already exists, a small amount of additional mixing may cause extinction. Our results are relevant to the global mixing of species due to human intervention and to global transport of infectious disease.}

abstract = {The regulation of organelle abundance sustains critical biological processes, such as metabolism and energy production. Biochemical models mathematically express these temporal changes in terms of reactions, and their rates. The rate parameters are critical components of the models, and must be experimentally inferred. However, the existing methods for rate inference are limited, and not directly applicable to organelle dynamics.This manuscript introduces a novel approach that integrates modeling, inference and experimentation, and incorporates biological replicates, to accurately infer the rates. The approach relies on a biochemical model in form of a stochastic differential equation, and on a parallel implementation of inference with particle filter. It also relies on a novel microscopy workflow that monitors organelles over long periods of time in cell culture. Evaluations on simulated datasets demonstrated the advantages of this approach in terms of increased accuracy and shortened computation time. An application to imaging of peroxisomes determined that fission, rather than de novo generation, is predominant in maintaining the organelle level under basal conditions. This biological insight serves as a starting point for a system view of organelle regulation in cells.}

abstract = {Coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections in humans and outbreaks of deadly pneumonia worldwide. Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which binds to host receptors and fuses the viral and cellular membranes. To understand the molecular basis of coronavirus attachment to oligosaccharide receptors, we determined cryo-{EM} structures of coronavirus {OC43} S glycoprotein trimer in isolation and in complex with a 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. We show that the ligand binds with fast kinetics to a surface-exposed groove and that interactions at the identified site are essential for S-mediated viral entry into host cells, but free monosaccharide does not trigger fusogenic conformational changes. The receptor-interacting site is conserved in all coronavirus S glycoproteins that engage 9-O-acetyl-sialogycans, with an architecture similar to those of the ligand-binding pockets of coronavirus hemagglutinin esterases and influenza virus C/D hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoproteins. Our results demonstrate these viruses evolved similar strategies to engage sialoglycans at the surface of target cells.}

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some {RNA}-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting {COVID}-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's {RNA}-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to {COVID}-19 patients if it is available.

Also, interactions between identified {CTL} epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five {CTL} epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the {CTL} epitopes were observed to be binding {MHC} class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-{nCoV} vaccines. \copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

We reviewed medical records for documented exposure history associated with respiratory infectious diseases, collected throat samples that were tested for seasonal and avian influenza, and interviewed clinicians regarding reasons for reporting or not reporting {PUE} cases. We described and analyzed the proportion of {PUE} cases reported and clinician awareness of and practices related to the {PUE} system. {RESULTS}: Of 2619 {ARI} admissions in two hospitals, 335(13\%) met the {PUE} case definition; none were reported. Of 311 specimens tested, 18(6\%) were seasonal influenza virus-positive; none were avian influenza-positive. \textless  10\% {PUE} case medical records documented whether or not there were exposures to animals or others with respiratory illness. Most commonly cited reasons for not reporting cases were no awareness of the {PUE} system (76\%) and not understanding the case definition (53\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Most clinicians have limited awareness of and are not reporting to the {PUE} system. Exposures related to respiratory infections are rarely documented in medical records. Increasing clinicians' awareness of the {PUE} system and including relevant exposure items in standard medical records may increase reporting.}

Patients infected with 2019-{nCoV} are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-{nCoV}. Although understanding of the 2019-{nCoV} virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.}

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since {SARS}-{CoV} was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as {SARS}-{CoV} and the recent {SARS}-{CoV}-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human {ACE2} is the receptor for the recently emerging {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing ({NLP}), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in {NLP} to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model {BERT} can be adapted for biomedical corpora. {RESULTS}: We introduce {BioBERT} (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, {BioBERT} largely outperforms {BERT} and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While {BERT} obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, {BioBERT} significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62\% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80\% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24\% {MRR} improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training {BERT} on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: We make the pre-trained weights of {BioBERT} freely available at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning {BioBERT} available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

To investigate the potential route of 2019-{nCov} infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk {RNA}-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression ({FANTOM5} {CAGE}) dataset were collected. {RNA}-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from {TCGA} and 14 organ types with normal tissues from {FANTOM5} {CAGE} were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of {ACE2} on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the {ACE2}-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the {ACE2} expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-{nCoV} infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.}

The symptoms of {COVID}-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ({BALF}) from 3 severe and 3 mild {COVID}-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell {RNA} sequence ({scRNA}-seq) combined with {TCR}-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived {FCN1}+ macrophages, whereas {notFABP4}+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in {BALF} from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with {ARDS}. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal {CD8}+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of {COVID}-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in {COVID}-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in {COVID}-19.}

Related {HEs} occur in influenza C, toro-, and coronaviruses, apparently as a result of relatively recent lateral gene transfer events. Here, we report the crystal structure of a coronavirus ({CoV}) {HE} in complex with its receptor. We show that {CoV} {HE} arose from an influenza C-like {HE} fusion protein ({HEF}). In the process, {HE} was transformed from a trimer into a dimer, whereas remnants of the fusion domain were adapted to establish novel monomer-monomer contacts. Whereas the structural design of the {RDE}-acetylesterase domain remained unaltered, the {HE} receptor-binding domain underwent remodeling to such extent that the ligand is now bound in opposite orientation. This is surprising, because the architecture of the {HEF} site was preserved in influenza A {HA} over a much larger evolutionary distance, a switch in receptor specificity and extensive antigenic variation notwithstanding. Apparently, {HA} and {HEF} are under more stringent selective constraints than {HE}, limiting their exploration of alternative binding-site topologies. We attribute the plasticity of the {CoV} {HE} receptor-binding site to evolutionary flexibility conferred by functional redundancy between {HE} and its companion spike protein S. Our findings offer unique insights into the structural and functional consequences of independent protein evolution after interviral gene exchange and open potential avenues to broad-spectrum antiviral drug design.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients. {METHODS}: We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit ({ICU}), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. {RESULTS}: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9\% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1\%), including 5.0\% who were admitted to the {ICU}, 2.3\% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4\% who died. Only 1.9\% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3\% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3\% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8\% on admission and 88.7\% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8\%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8\%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography ({CT}) (56.4\%). No radiographic or {CT} abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9\%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9\%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2\% of the patients on admission. {CONCLUSIONS}: During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.).

However, two outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}), as a result of zoonotic {CoVs} crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. This brought {CoVs} global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses. For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species. We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}, but also these emerging coronaviral diseases.}

The high fatality rate (35.4\%) of this novel coronavirus and its persistent wide spread infectiousness in animal reservoirs have generated tremendous global public health concern. However, no licensed therapeutic agents or vaccines against {MERS}-{CoV} are currently available and only a limited few have entered clinical trials. Among all the potential targets of {MERS}-{CoV}, the spike glycoprotein (S) has been the most well-studied due to its critical role in mediating viral entry and in inducing a protective antibody response in infected individuals. The most notable studies include the recent discoveries of monoclonal antibodies and development of candidate vaccines against the S glycoprotein. Structural characterization of {MERS}-{CoV} S protein bound with these monoclonal antibodies has provided insights into the mechanisms of humoral immune responses against {MERS}-{CoV} infection. The current review aims to highlight these developments and discuss possible hurdles and strategies to translate these discoveries into ultimate medical interventions against {MERS}-{CoV} infection.}

abstract = {Lower respiratory infection caused by human pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus ({RSV}) is a significant healthcare burden that must be addressed. The preferred options to achieve this goal are usually to develop vaccines for prophylaxis and to develop antiviral small molecules to treat infected patients with convenient, orally administrable drugs. However, developing a vaccine against {RSV} poses special challenges with the diminished immune system of infants and the elderly, and finding a universal flu vaccine is difficult because the product must target a large array of viral strains. On the other hand, the use of small-molecule antivirals can result in the emergence of resistant viruses as it has well-been reported for {HIV}, influenza, and hepatitis C virus ({HCV}). This paper reviews peptide antiviral strategies as an alternative to address these challenges. The discovery of influenza and {RSV} peptidic fusion inhibitors will be discussed and compared to small molecules in view of escape mutations. The importance of constraining peptides into macrocycles to improve both their inhibitory activity and pharmacological properties will be highlighted.}

This virus shares highly homological sequence with {SARS}-{CoV}, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}. The most characteristic symptom of patients with {COVID}-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with {COVID}-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of {SARS}-{CoV} has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between {SARS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV2}, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of {SARS}-{CoV2} is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with {COVID}-19. Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2-induced respiratory failure. \copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

We developed {TooManyCells}, a suite of graph-based algorithms for efficient and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades. {TooManyCells} introduces a visualization model built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to dimensionality-reduction methods. {TooManyCells} is also equipped with an efficient matrix-free divisive hierarchical spectral clustering different from prevalent single-resolution clustering methods. {TooManyCells} enables multiresolution and multifaceted exploration of single-cell clades. An advantage of this paradigm is the immediate detection of rare and common populations that outperforms popular clustering and visualization algorithms, as demonstrated using existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets and new data modeling drug-resistance acquisition in leukemic T cells.}

abstract = {Immune memory is a defining feature of the acquired immune system, but activation of the innate immune system can also result in enhanced responsiveness to subsequent triggers. This process has been termed 'trained immunity', a de facto innate immune memory. Research in the past decade has pointed to the broad benefits of trained immunity for host defence but has also suggested potentially detrimental outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we define 'trained immunity' as a biological process and discuss the innate stimuli and the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming events that shape the induction of trained immunity.}

abstract = {Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell {RNA}-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are (i) associated with the lineages in the trajectory, or (ii) differentially expressed between lineages, to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce {tradeSeq}, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation. We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.}

In the last 15 years, we have witnessed the emergence of two zoonotic, highly pathogenic {HCoVs}: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}). Replication of {HCoV} is regulated by a diversity of host factors and induces drastic alterations in cellular structure and physiology. Activation of critical signaling pathways during {HCoV} infection modulates the induction of antiviral immune response and contributes to the pathogenesis of {HCoV}. Recent studies have begun to reveal some fundamental aspects of the intricate {HCoV}-host interaction in mechanistic detail. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of host factors co-opted and signaling pathways activated during {HCoV} infection, with an emphasis on {HCoV}-infection-induced stress response, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immunity. The cross talk among these pathways, as well as the modulatory strategies utilized by {HCoV}, is also discussed.}

Unravelling which cellular factors are used by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 uses the {SARS}-{CoV} receptor {ACE2} for entry and the serine protease {TMPR\SS2} for S protein priming.

Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including {ZINC} drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease ({3CLpro}), Spike, {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase ({RdRp}), and papain like protease ({PLpro}) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections. \copyright 2020 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

abstract = {Virus attachment to host cells is mediated by dedicated virion proteins, which specifically recognize one or, at most, a limited number of cell surface molecules. Receptor binding often involves protein-protein interactions, but carbohydrates may serve as receptor determinants as well. In fact, many different viruses use members of the sialic acid family either as their main receptor or as an initial attachment factor. Sialic acids (Sias) are 9-carbon negatively-charged monosaccharides commonly occurring as terminal residues of glycoconjugates. They come in a large variety and are differentially expressed in cells and tissues. By targeting specific Sia subtypes, viruses achieve host cell selectivity, but only to a certain extent. The Sia of choice might still be abundantly present on non-cell associated molecules, on non-target cells (including cells already infected) and even on virus particles themselves. This poses a hazard, as high-affinity virion binding to any of such "false'' receptors would result in loss of infectivity. Some enveloped {RNA} viruses deal with this problem by encoding virion-associated receptor-destroying enzymes ({RDEs}). These enzymes make the attachment to Sia reversible, thus providing the virus with an escape ticket. {RDEs} occur in two types: neuraminidases and sialate-O-acetylesterases. The latter, originally discovered in influenza C virus, are also found in certain nidoviruses, namely in group 2 coronaviruses and in toroviruses, as well as in infectious salmon anemia virus, an orthomyxovirus of teleosts. Here, the structure, function and evolution of viral sialate-O-acetylesterases is reviewed with main focus on the hemagglutinin-esterases of nidoviruses.}

Like related animal {\beta1CoVs}, {OC43} uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as receptor determinant. {\beta1CoV} receptor binding is typically controlled by attachment/fusion spike protein S and receptor-binding/receptor-destroying hemagglutinin-esterase protein {HE}. We show that following {OC43}'s introduction into humans, {HE}-mediated receptor binding was selected against and ultimately lost through progressive accumulation of mutations in the {HE} lectin domain. Consequently, virion-associated receptor-destroying activity toward multivalent glycoconjugates was reduced and altered such that some clustered receptor populations are no longer cleaved. Loss of {HE} lectin function was also observed for another respiratory human coronavirus, {HKU1}. This thus appears to be an adaptation to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract and for replication in human airways. The findings suggest that the dynamics of virion-glycan interactions contribute to host tropism. Our observations are relevant also to other human respiratory viruses of zoonotic origin, particularly influenza A virus. Copyright \copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Abstract Background Rapid spread of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen {CDC} identified 391 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection ({ORs} 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15\%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into {SARS}-{CoV}-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.}

abstract = {Crosstalk between neighboring cells underlies many biological processes, including cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation. Current single-cell genomic technologies profile each cell separately after tissue dissociation, losing information on cell-cell interactions. In the present study, we present an approach for sequencing physically interacting cells ({PIC}-seq), which combines cell sorting of physically interacting cells ({PICs}) with single-cell {RNA}-sequencing. Using computational modeling, {PIC}-seq systematically maps in situ cellular interactions and characterizes their molecular crosstalk. We apply {PIC}-seq to interrogate diverse interactions including immune-epithelial {PICs} in neonatal murine lungs. Focusing on interactions between T cells and dendritic cells ({DCs}) in vitro and in vivo, we map T cell-{DC} interaction preferences, and discover regulatory T cells as a major T cell subtype interacting with {DCs} in mouse draining lymph nodes. Analysis of T cell-{DC} pairs reveals an interaction-specific program between pathogen-presenting migratory {DCs} and T cells. {PIC}-seq provides a direct and broadly applicable technology to characterize intercellular interaction-specific pathways at high resolution.}

Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of {COVID}-19. Person-to-person transmission of {COVID}-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of {COVID}-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.

Host immune responses to {CoV} are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit {CoV} are not well characterized. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E ({LY6E}) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple {CoVs}, including {SARS}-{CoV}, {SARS}-{CoV}-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}). Mechanistic studies revealed that {LY6E} inhibits {CoV} entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine {CoV} infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine {CoV} infection. Our results demonstrate that {LY6E} is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls {CoV} infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of {CoV} in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging {CoV}.}

The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-{CoV} ({MERS}-{CoV}) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel {CoV} ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is currently lower than {SARS}-{CoV}, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of {CoVs} into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human {CoV} outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.}

Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 ({AT1R}) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) very likely serves as the binding site for {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the strain implicated in the current {COVID}-19 epidemic, similarly to strain {SARS}-{CoV} implicated in the 2002-2003 {SARS} epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering {AT1R} blockers as tentative treatment for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility. \copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

Increased {ACE} and Ang {II} are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that {RAS} inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of {COVID}-19 and {ACE2} resulted in the exhaustion of {ACE2}, and then {ACE2}/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the {RAS} system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.

The evolutionary relationship between 2019-{nCoV} and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-{nCoV} with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-{nCoV} proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-{nCoV} to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-{nCoV} is most closely related to {BatCoV} {RaTG13} and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with {SARS} coronavirus and Bat-{SARS}-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-{nCoV} protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-{nCoV} proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, {NS7b} and {NS8}, were exclusively conserved among 2019-{nCoV}, {BetaCoV\_RaTG}, and {BatSARS}-like Cov. {NS7b} and {NS8} have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the {SARS}-{CoV} experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the {NS7b} and {NS8} proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-{nCoV}.

abstract = {The initial cluster of severe pneumonia cases that triggered the {COVID}-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-{nCoV} outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409-7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128-1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 and 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588-13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). We also observe that each of the models predicts that the epidemic has reached saturation in both Hubei and other provinces. Our findings suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) are lethal zoonotic viruses that have emerged into human populations these past 15 years. These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ({ARDS}). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of {SARS}-{CoV} from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of {MERS}-{CoV} circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Treatment of {SARS} and {MERS} in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from {SARS} and {MERS} outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.}

In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of {TMPR\SS2} during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} infection to investigate the role of {TMPR\SS2}. Th1-prone {C57BL}/6 mice and {TMPR\SS2}-knockout ({KO}) mice were used for {SARS}-{CoV} infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human {MERS}-{CoV} receptor {DPP4} ({hDPP4}-Tg mice) and {TMPR\SS2}-{KO} {hDPP4}-Tg mice were used for {MERS}-{CoV} infection. After experimental infection, {TMPR\SS2}-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of {TMPR\SS2} affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, {TMPR\SS2}-{KO} mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(I·C), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, {TMPR\SS2} plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} and in the resulting immunopathology.{IMPORTANCE} Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 ({TMPR\SS2}), a protease belonging to the type {II} transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the coronavirus spike protein, making it a potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infections. Here, we examined the role of {TMPR\SS2} using animal models of {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} infection. The results suggest that lack of {TMPR\SS2} in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}. Taken together, the results will facilitate development of novel targets for coronavirus therapy. Copyright \copyright 2019 American Society for Microbiology.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) was first described in 2012 and attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. The disease carries a high case fatality rate of 34.5\%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy. {METHOD}: We searched {MEDLINE}, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of {MERS}. {RESULTS}: Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is in a randomized control trial. Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience comes from a number of observational studies. Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be of potential benefit and deserve further investigation. There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend specific therapy for the treatment of {MERS}-{CoV} infection. Only one such study is planned for randomization and is pending completion. The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b. A fully human polyclonal {IgG} antibody ({SAB}-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent may deserve further testing for efficacy. {CONCLUSION}: Despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for {MERS}-{CoV}. Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. In order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for {MERS}-{CoV} infection, repurposing old drugs against {MERS}-{CoV} is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent {COVID}-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for {COVID}-19 virus based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The immunogenicity of these epitopes was identified using {IFN}-\gamma {ELIspot} assays. The {IFN}-\gamma producing T cell variation ranged from 11.1 ±1.2 {SFU} to 38.2 ± 2.1 {SFU} per 10 6 {PBMCs}. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to {50S} ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with {MHC}-I and {MHC}-{II} molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with {50S} ribosomal protein L7/L12 was very stable with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.}

abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2, a novel coronavirus ({CoV}), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original {SARS}-{CoV}, both group {2B} coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from {SARS}-{CoV} infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 relative to the original {SARS}-{CoV}. Our results indicate that while {SARS}-{CoV}-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to {SARS}-{CoV} in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between {SARS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame ({ORF}) 3b and significant changes to {ORF6} suggest the two key {IFN} antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the {IFN} response between {SARS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.}

One current issue is the ability to adequately screen for the virus causing {COVID}-2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of shotgun proteomics as a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 screening method, through the detection of viral peptides in proteolytically digested body fluids. Using in silico methods, we generated trypsin-based shotgun proteomics methods optimized for {LCMS} systems from 5 commercial instrument vendors (Thermo, {SCIEX}, Waters, Shimadzu, and Agilent). First, we generated protein {FASTA} files and their protein digest maps. Second, the {FASTA} files were used to generate spectral libraries based on experimental data. Third, transition lists were derived from the spectral libraries using the vendor neutral and open Skyline software environment. Finally, we identified 17 post-translational modifications using linear motif modeling.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with {COVID}-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. {METHODS}: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral {RNA} detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. {FINDINGS}: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48\%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30\%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19\%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8\%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95\% {CI} 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ({SOFA}) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p\textless 0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/{mL} (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days ({IQR} 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. {INTERPRETATION}: The potential risk factors of older age, high {SOFA} score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/{mL} could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future. {FUNDING}: Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.

We have cloned, expressed, and purified a Strep-fused recombinant {MERS}-{CoV} nonstructural protein 13 (M-nsp13) helicase. Characterization of its biochemical properties showed that it unwound {DNA} and {RNA} similarly to severe acute respiratory syndrome {CoV} nsp13 (S-nsp13) helicase. We showed that M-nsp13 unwound in a 5'-to-3' direction and efficiently unwound the partially duplex {RNA} substrates with a long loading strand relative to those of the {RNA} substrates with a short or no loading strand. Moreover, the Km of {ATP} for M-nsp13 is inversely proportional to the length of the 5' loading strand of the partially duplex {RNA} substrates. Finally, we also showed that the rate of unwinding (ku) of M-nsp13 is directly proportional to the length of the 5' loading strand of the partially duplex {RNA} substrate. These results provide insights that enhance our understanding of the biochemical properties of M-nsp13. {IMPORTANCE} Coronaviruses are known to cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and the United States of America. Helicases are motor proteins that catalyze the processive separation of double-stranded nucleic acids into two single-stranded nucleic acids by utilizing the energy derived from {ATP} hydrolysis. {MERS}-{CoV} helicase is one of the most important viral replication enzymes of this coronavirus. Herein, we report the first bacterial expression, enzyme purification, and biochemical characterization of {MERS}-{CoV} helicase. The knowledge obtained from this study might be used to identify an inhibitor of {MERS}-{CoV} replication, and the helicase might be used as a therapeutic target.}

Transcription includes a template switch during the synthesis of subgenomic negative-strand {RNAs} to add a copy of the leader sequence. Coronavirus transcription is regulated by multiple factors, including the extent of base-pairing between transcription-regulating sequences of positive and negative polarity, viral and cell protein-{RNA} binding, and high-order {RNA}-{RNA} interactions. Coronavirus {RNA} synthesis is performed by a replication-transcription complex that includes viral and cell proteins that recognize cis-acting {RNA} elements mainly located in the highly structured 5' and 3' untranslated regions. In addition to many viral nonstructural proteins, the presence of cell nuclear proteins and the viral nucleocapsid protein increases virus amplification efficacy.

abstract = {{RNA} virus encodes a helicase essential for viral {RNA} transcription and replication when the genome size is larger than 7 kb. Coronavirus ({CoV}) has an exceptionally large {RNA} genome (\~30 kb) and it encodes an essential replicase, the nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13), a member of superfamily 1 helicases. Nsp13 is among the evolutionary most conserved proteins not only in {CoVs} but also in nidovirales. Thus, it is considered as an important drug target. However, the high-resolution structure of {CoV} nsp13 remained unavailable even until more than a decade after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) in 2003, which hindered the structure-based drug design. This is in part due to the intrinsic flexibility of nsp13. Here, we describe protocols of deducing the crystal structure of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) helicase in detail, which include protein expression, purification, crystallization, enzymatic characterization, and structure determination. With these methods, catalytically active recombinant {MERS}-{CoV} nsp13 protein can be prepared and crystallized and the crystal structure can be solved.}

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}), a newly identified group 2 coronavirus, is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening form of pneumonia in humans. Coronavirus replication and transcription are highly specialized processes of cytoplasmic {RNA} synthesis that localize to virus-induced membrane structures and were recently proposed to involve a complex enzymatic machinery that, besides {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase, helicase, and protease activities, also involves a series of {RNA}-processing enzymes that are not found in most other {RNA} virus families. Here, we characterized the enzymatic activities of a recombinant form of the {SARS}-{CoV} helicase (nonstructural protein [nsp] 13), a superfamily 1 helicase with an N-terminal zinc-binding domain. We report that nsp13 has both {RNA} and {DNA} duplex-unwinding activities. {SARS}-{CoV} nsp13 unwinds its substrates in a 5'-to-3' direction and features a remarkable processivity, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded {RNA} and {DNA}. Characterization of the nsp13-associated (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphatase ([{dNTPase}) activities revealed that all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with {ATP}, {dATP}, and {GTP} being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides. Furthermore, we established an {RNA} 5'-triphosphatase activity for the {SARS}-{CoV} nsp13 helicase which may be involved in the formation of the 5' cap structure of viral {RNAs}. The data suggest that the (d){NTPase} and {RNA} 5'-triphosphatase activities of nsp13 have a common active site. Finally, we established that, in {SARS}-{CoV}-infected Vero E6 cells, nsp13 localizes to membranes that appear to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are the likely site of {SARS}-{CoV} {RNA} synthesis.}

This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-{nCov} was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), with {SARS}-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell {RNA}-Seq technique, we analyzed the {ACE2} {RNA} expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the {ACE2} virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type {II} alveolar cells ({AT2}).

A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of {ACE2}-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-{nCov} infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-{ACE2} therapeutic strategy development.}

abstract = {Virus and host factors contribute to cell-to-cell variation in viral infections and determine the outcome of the overall infection. However, the extent of the variability at the single-cell level and how it impacts virus-host interactions at a system level are not well understood. To characterize the dynamics of viral transcription and host responses, we used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to quantify at multiple time points the host and viral transcriptomes of human A549 cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells infected with influenza A virus. We observed substantial variability in viral transcription between cells, including the accumulation of defective viral genomes ({DVGs}) that impact viral replication. We show (i) a correlation between {DVGs} and virus-induced variation of the host transcriptional program and (ii) an association between differential inductions of innate immune response genes and attenuated viral transcription in subpopulations of cells. These observations at the single-cell level improve our understanding of the complex virus-host interplay during influenza virus infection.{IMPORTANCE} Defective influenza virus particles generated during viral replication carry incomplete viral genomes and can interfere with the replication of competent viruses. These defective genomes are thought to modulate the disease severity and pathogenicity of an influenza virus infection. Different defective viral genomes also introduce another source of variation across a heterogeneous cell population. Evaluating the impact of defective virus genomes on host cell responses cannot be fully resolved at the population level, requiring single-cell transcriptional profiling. Here, we characterized virus and host transcriptomes in individual influenza virus-infected cells, including those of defective viruses that arise during influenza A virus infection. We established an association between defective virus transcription and host responses and validated interfering and immunostimulatory functions of identified dominant defective viral genome species in vitro This study demonstrates the intricate effects of defective viral genomes on host transcriptional responses and highlights the importance of capturing host-virus interactions at the single-cell level.

abstract = {Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of {COVID}-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with {COVID}-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) or died. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed {COVID}-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed {COVID}-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures: The development of {ARDS} and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. Results: Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7\%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8\%) developed {ARDS}, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4\%) died. In those who developed {ARDS}, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5\%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6\%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9\%; 95\% {CI}, 19.7\%-48.1\%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4\%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7\%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7\%; 95\% {CI}, 1.3\%-26.1\%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0\%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1\%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9\%; 95\% {CI}, 3.6\%-24.2\%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of {ARDS} and progression from {ARDS} to death included older age (hazard ratio [{HR}], 3.26; 95\% {CI} 2.08-5.11; and {HR}, 6.17; 95\% {CI}, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia ({HR}, 1.14; 95\% {CI}, 1.09-1.19; and {HR}, 1.08; 95\% {CI}, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [{HR}, 1.61; 95\% {CI}, 1.44-1.79; and {HR}, 1.30; 95\% {CI}, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [{HR}, 1.03; 95\% {CI}, 1.01-1.04; and {HR}, 1.02; 95\% {CI}, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of {ARDS} development ({HR}, 1.77; 95\% {CI}, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death ({HR}, 0.41; 95\% {CI}, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with {ARDS}, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death ({HR}, 0.38; 95\% {CI}, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance: Older age was associated with greater risk of development of {ARDS} and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of {ARDS}, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with {ARDS}. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop {ARDS}.}

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of {COVID}-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to {SARS}-{CoV}, {COVID}-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of {ACE2} in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by {COIVD}-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of {ACE2} in the {CNS}, the host-virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the {COVID}-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging {COVID}-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.}

The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on {COVID}-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-{nCoV} provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and {DXY}. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China.

As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization ({WHO}) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with \textgreater99\% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the {WHO} declared {COVID}-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-{SL}-{CoVZC45} and bat-{SL}-{CoVZXC21}. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pneumonia in the {USA} is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond.

The recombinant protein also had both {RNA} and {DNA} duplex-unwinding activities with 5'-to-3' polarity.

The primer set seems to have been adapted already by many researchers worldwide and contributed for the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this potential pandemic virus. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set was able to amplify all desired {PCR} products with fairy small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we observed acute drop of reads derived from two particular {PCR} products, 18 and 76, out of the 98 designated products as sample's viral load decreases. We suspected the reason for this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers used to amplify those two {PCR} products. Here, we propose replacing just one of those primers, {nCoV}-{2019\_76\_RIGHT}(-), to a newly designed primer. The result of the replacement of primer showed improvement in coverage at both regions targeted by the products, 18 and 76. We expect this simple modification will extend the limit for whole {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome analysis to samples with lower viral load and enhance genomic epidemiology of this pathogen.}

A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction ({ddPCR}) method was employed to quantitate the viral {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RNA} genome and determine aerosol {RNA} concentration. {RESULTS}: The {ICU}, {CCU} and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne {SARS}-{CoV}-2 concentration but deposition samples inside {ICU} and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in Fangcang {MSA} had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. {PUA} had undetectable airborne {SARS}-{CoV}-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. {CONCLUSIONS}: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. {METHODS} We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. {RESULTS} We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100\% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6\% of diagnosed {COVID}-19 patients. {CONCLUSIONS} Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of {COVID}-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.}

The knowledge of the {3D} structures of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as {SARS}-{CoV}, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain ({RBD}) of the Spike proteins from {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV}. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of {RBDs} in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several {SARS}-{CoV} {RDB}-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} that is engaged by the cell receptor {ACE2} during viral entry into host cells. The data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.}

abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the {COVID}-19 pandemic. The genome of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. {DNA} nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic {RNA} and subgenomic {RNAs} common in all coronaviruses, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown {ORFs} with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct {RNA} sequencing, we further find at least 41 {RNA} modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being {AAGAA}. Modified {RNAs} have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified {RNAs}, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown {ORFs} and {RNA} modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

There is no cure for {COVID}-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a {CRISPR}-Cas13-based strategy, {PAC}-{MAN} (Prophylactic Antiviral {CRISPR} in {huMAN} cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade {SARS}-{CoV}-2 sequences and live influenza A virus ({IAV}) genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of {CRISPR} {RNAs} ({crRNAs}) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional {crRNAs} for cleaving {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for {H1N1} {IAV}. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six {crRNAs} can target more than 90\% of all coronaviruses. The {PAC}-{MAN} approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.}

The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of {COVID}-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.}

abstract = {Currently, {COVID}-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has been widely spread around the world; nevertheless, so far there exist no specific antiviral drugs for treatment of the disease, which poses great challenge to control and contain the virus. Here, we reported a research finding that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of {CD147}-spike protein ({SP}). {SP} bound to {CD147}, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion. Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-{CD147} humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an {EC50} of 24.86 μg/{mL} and {IC50} of 15.16 μg/{mL}. Second, we validated the interaction between {CD147} and {SP}, with an affinity constant of 1.{85E}-{07M}. Co-Immunoprecipitation and {ELISA} also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of {CD147} and {SP} was observed in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route {CD147}-{SP} for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs.}

The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with already published reports on {SARS}-{CoV}-2 indicated that it is closely related to Bat-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome like coronavirus (Bat {CoV} {SARS}-like) and well-studied Human {SARS}. In this study, we have exploited the complementary approach to examine the intrinsically disordered regions in proteome of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 using Bat {SARS}-like and Human {SARS} {CoVs} as comparative models. According to our findings, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteome contains a significant amount of ordered proteins except Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and {ORF6}.

Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59\% of the positive cases were identified by {RT}-{PCR}, probably due to loss or degradation of virus {RNA} in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-{PCR}-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect {SARS}-{CoV}-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-{PCR}-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect {SARS}-{CoV}-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.}

Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and {SARS}-{CoV} {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase ({RdRp}), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity {DNA} polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and {AZT} (an {FDA} approved {HIV}/{AIDS} drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of {SARS}-{CoV} {RdRp}. We demonstrate the ability of two {HIV} reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3′-fluoro-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and {AZT}), to be incorporated by {SARS}-{CoV} {RdRp} where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98\% amino acid similarity of the {SARS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RdRps}, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 polymerase.

Further phylogenetic analysis and {RSCU} heat map results suggested that {ZJ01} may be a potential evolutionary branch of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. {ZJ01} were both T at these two sites, becoming the only {TT} type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site ({FCS}) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that {FCS} may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. {ZJ01} had mutations near {FCS} (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and {ACE2}-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while {FCS} may help {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 towards {FCS} formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to {HKU}-1 and {OC43} (the source of {FCS} sequence-{PRRA}) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild {COVID}-19 subtypes.}

Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a {COVID}-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.}

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95\%{CI}: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95\%{CI}: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the {COVID}-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.}

We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the {QSEIR} model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80\% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43\%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the {QSEIR} model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the {QSEIR} model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.}

Therefore, we herein used a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of {SARS}-{CoV}. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-{HB}) core of the {HR1} and {HR2} domains in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the {HR1} domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with {HR2} domain.

We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the {EK1C4} was the most potent fusion inhibitor against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with {IC50s} of 1.3 and 15.8 {nM}, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of {EK1} peptide, respectively. {EK1C4} was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}, as well as {SARSr}-{CoVs}, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Intranasal application of {EK1C4} before or after challenge with {HCoV}-{OC43} protected mice from infection, suggesting that {EK1C4} could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and emerging {SARSr}-{CoVs}.}

Cross-reactivity of {RT}-{LAMP} assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our {RT}-{LAMP} assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.}

abstract = {To date, the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than {SARS}-{CoV} or {MERS}-{CoV}. Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 ({ORF8}) of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. The deletion also removes the {ORF8} transcription-regulatory sequence ({TRS}), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the {SARS}-{CoV} outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population, and similar variation has since been observed across {SARS}-related {CoVs} in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in {ORF8}, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human {SARS} cases possessed an {ORF8} deletion that may be associated with host adaptation. We therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

abstract = {Mobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R​ 0 \textless​1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of {COVID}-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R​ 0 \textless​1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen {SARS}-{CoV}-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. We show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity.}

We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the {COVID}-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the {COVID}-19 epidemic.}

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The retrospective study using the past {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-{ADP}-ribose polymerase 1 ({PARP1}) inhibitor, {CVL218}, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat {COVID}-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that {CVL218} can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that {CVL218} is able to suppress the {CpG}-induced {IL}-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of {CVL218} in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that {CVL218} may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of {PARP1} inhibitors against {SARS}-{CoV}-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the {PARP1} inhibitor {CVL218} discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of {COVID}-19.}

Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (the cause of {COVID}-19) replication ({EC} 90 ) was 6.3 μM. After the eleventh consecutive {MERS}-{CoV} passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution ({A25V}) in nonstructural protein ({NSP}) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering {MERS} or {COVID}-19.}

Existing direct-acting antiviral ({DAA}) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new {DAA} drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral ({HTA}) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of {DHODH}, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various {RNA} viruses, including influenza A virus ({H1N1}, {H3N2}, {H9N2}), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Our results are the first to validate that {DHODH} is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in {DHODH} knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of {DAA} and {HTA} was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an {EC50} of {17nM} and {SI} value \textgreater5882 in {SARS}-{CoV}-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to {COVID}-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.}

Instead of treating dropouts as a problem to be fixed, we embrace it as a useful signal. We represent the dropout pattern by binarizing single-cell {RNA}-seq count data, and present a co-occurrence clustering algorithm to cluster cells based on the dropout pattern. We demonstrate in multiple published datasets that the binary dropout pattern is as informative as the quantitative expression of highly variable genes for the purpose of identifying cell types.

Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (virus causing {COVID}-19) in vitro. {CONCLUSIONS}: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with {COVID}-19.

In addition, the cell-culture-adapted {HCoV}-{OC43} lost the ability to infect and replicate in air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells.

The largest of the {SARS}-{CoV} accessory protein open reading frames ({SARS} 3a) oligomerizes, dynamically inserting into late endosomal, lysosomal, and trans-Golgi-network membranes. While previously implicated in a non-inflammatory apoptotic cell death pathway, here we extend the range of {SARS} 3a pathophysiologic targets by examining its effects on necrotic cell death pathways. We show that {SARS} 3a interacts with Receptor Interacting Protein 3 (Rip3), which augments the oligomerization of {SARS} 3a helping drive necrotic cell death. In addition, by inserting into lysosomal membranes {SARS} 3a triggers lysosomal damage and dysfunction. Consequently, Transcription Factor {EB} ({TFEB}) translocates to the nucleus increasing the transcription of autophagy- and lysosome-related genes. Finally, {SARS} 3a activates caspase-1 either directly or via an enhanced potassium efflux, which triggers {NLRP3} inflammasome assembly. In summary, Rip3-mediated oligomerization of {SARS} 3a causes necrotic cell death, lysosomal damage, and caspase-1 activation-all likely contributing to the clinical manifestations of {SARS}-{CoV} infection.}

The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic-structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 ({AS}-{SCoV2}). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The {AS}-{SCoV2} located in the acidic-domain of papain-like protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and bat-{SL}-{CoV}-{RatG13} guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat-{SL}-{CoV}-{RaTG13}. The implication of this amino acid signature in papain-like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored. \copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 days, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS}: Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of {COVID}-19 improvement.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including {SARS}-{CoV}-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of {COVID}-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication cycle. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes respiratory infection in humans, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. In dromedary camels, the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals. Differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals, as well as between humans and dromedary camels, highlight the role of host factors in {MERS}-{CoV} pathogenesis and transmission. One of these host factors, the {MERS}-{CoV} receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ({DPP4}), may be a critical determinant because it is variably expressed in {MERS}-{CoV}-susceptible species as well as in humans. This could partially explain inter- and intraspecies differences in the tropism, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of {MERS}-{CoV}. In this review, we explore the role of {DPP4} and other host factors in {MERS}-{CoV} transmission and pathogenesis-such as sialic acids, host proteases, and interferons. Further characterization of these host determinants may potentially offer novel insights to develop intervention strategies to tackle ongoing outbreaks.}

Related clinical features are needed. {METHODS}: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020. {RESULTS}: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years ({IQR} 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46\%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87\%]), cough (38[55\%]), and fatigue (29[42\%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5\%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5\%] of 67 patients). As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9\%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5\%. According to the lowest {SpO2} during admission, cases were divided into the {SpO2}≥90\% group (n=55) and the {SpO2\textless} 90\% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the {SpO2\textless} 90\% group. Compared with {SpO2}≥90\% group, patients of the {SpO2\textless} 90\% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of {IL6}, {IL10}, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. {CONCLUSIONS}: {COVID}-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5\%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death. \copyright The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. {METHODS}: In this study, the {COVID}-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 ({GRP78})) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The {COVID}-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the {SARS} spike. {RESULTS}: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the {GRP78} Substrate Binding Domain \beta ({SBD\beta}). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the {SBD\beta} of {GRP78} and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. {CONCLUSIONS}: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions {III} (C391-C525) and {IV} (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and {GRP78}. Region {IV} is the main driving force for {GRP78} binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against {COVID}-19.

New lethal animal models for {SARS} were needed to facilitate antiviral research. We adapted and characterized a new strain of {SARS}-{CoV} (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old {BALB}/c mice. It had nine mutations affecting 10 amino acid residues. Strain v2163 increased {IL}-1alpha, {IL}-6, {MIP}-1alpha, {MCP}-1, and {RANTES} in mice, and high {IL}-6 expression correlated with mortality. The infection largely mimicked human disease, but lung pathology lacked hyaline membrane formation. In vitro efficacy against v2163 was shown with known inhibitors of {SARS}-{CoV} replication. In v2163-infected mice, Ampligen was fully protective, stinging nettle lectin ({UDA}) was partially protective, ribavirin was disputable and possibly exacerbated disease, and {EP128533} was inactive. Ribavirin, {UDA}, and Ampligen decreased {IL}-6 expression. Strain v2163 provided a valuable model for anti-{SARS} research.}

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. {RESULTS}: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2\% vs. 25.0\%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95\% {CI}, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral {RNA} at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95\% {CI}, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8\%) because of adverse events. {CONCLUSIONS}: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the {COVID}-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe {COVID}-19-associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported {COVID}-19 cases in China were mild (81\%), approximately 80\% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥60 years; only one (0.1\%) death occurred in a person aged ≤19 years (3). In this report, {COVID}-19 cases in the United States that occurred during February 12-March 16, 2020 and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [{ICU}], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of March 16, a total of 4,226 {COVID}-19 cases in the United States had been reported to {CDC}, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities (4). Overall, 31\% of cases, 45\% of hospitalizations, 53\% of {ICU} admissions, and 80\% of deaths associated with {COVID}-19 were among adults aged ≥65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged ≥85 years. In contrast, no {ICU} admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged ≤19 years.

abstract = {An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}-2, previously known as 2019-{nCoV}), the coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization ({WHO}) officially declared the {COVID}-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4\%) had been reported by {WHO}. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 belongs to \beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) as that for {SARS}-{CoV}, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of {COVID}-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of {COVID}-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.}

A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death. Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of {COVID}-19 in Wuhan was 1.4\% (0.9-2.1\%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naïve confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557 = 4.5\%) and the approximator1 of deaths/deaths + recoveries (2,169/2,169 + 17,572 = 11\%) as of 29 February 2020. Compared to those aged 30-59 years, those aged below 30 and above 59 years were 0.6 (0.3-1.1) and 5.1 (4.2-6.1) times more likely to die after developing symptoms.

Moreover, lung cells that have {ACE2} expression may be the main target cells during 2019-{nCoV} infection. However, some patients also exhibit non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-{nCoV} could also invade other organs. To construct a risk map of different human organs, we analyzed the single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems. Through {scRNA}-seq data analyses, we identified the organs at risk, such as lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum, and located specific cell types (i.e., type {II} alveolar cells ({AT2}), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells), which are vulnerable to 2019-{nCoV} infection. Based on the findings, we constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-{nCoV} infection.

abstract = {Human coronaviruses ({HCoVs}), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}, also known as {SARS}-{CoV}-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-{nCoV}/{SARS}-{CoV}-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the {HCoV}-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 {HCoV} whole genomes reveal that 2019-{nCoV}/{SARS}-{CoV}-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with {SARS}-{CoV} (79.7\%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-{nCoV}/{SARS}-{CoV}-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96\% and 89.6\%, respectively, compared to {SARS}-{CoV}. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and {HCoV}-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-{HCoV} repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and {HCoV}-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the "Complementary Exposure" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the {HCoV}-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-{nCoV}/{SARS}-{CoV}-2. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.}

Epidemiological data from the 2002-2003 {SARS} epidemic and recent Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak indicate that there may be sex-dependent differences in disease outcomes. To investigate these differences, we infected male and female mice of different age groups with {SARS}-{CoV} and analyzed their susceptibility to the infection. Our results showed that male mice were more susceptible to {SARS}-{CoV} infection compared with age-matched females. The degree of sex bias to {SARS}-{CoV} infection increased with advancing age, such that middle-aged mice showed much more pronounced differences compared with young mice. Enhanced susceptibility of male mice to {SARS}-{CoV} was associated with elevated virus titers, enhanced vascular leakage, and alveolar edema. These changes were accompanied by increased accumulation of inflammatory monocyte macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of male mice, and depletion of inflammatory monocyte macrophages partially protected these mice from lethal {SARS}. Moreover, the sex-specific differences were independent of T and B cell responses. Furthermore, ovariectomy or treating female mice with an estrogen receptor antagonist increased mortality, indicating a protective effect for estrogen receptor signaling in mice infected with {SARS}-{CoV}. Together, these data suggest that sex differences in the susceptibility to {SARS}-{CoV} in mice parallel those observed in patients and also identify estrogen receptor signaling as critical for protection in females.

Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. {RESULTS}: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. {CONCLUSION}: Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in {COVID}-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.

abstract = {Coronaviruses ({CoVs}) have emerged from animal reservoirs to cause severe and lethal disease in humans, but there are currently no {FDA}-approved antivirals to treat the infections. One class of antiviral compounds, nucleoside analogues, mimics naturally occurring nucleosides to inhibit viral replication. While these compounds have been successful therapeutics for several viral infections, mutagenic nucleoside analogues, such as ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil, have been ineffective at inhibiting {CoVs}. This has been attributed to the proofreading activity of the viral 3'-5' exoribonuclease ({ExoN}). \beta-d-N4-Hydroxycytidine ({NHC}) ({EIDD}-1931; Emory Institute for Drug Development) has recently been reported to inhibit multiple viruses. Here, we demonstrate that {NHC} inhibits both murine hepatitis virus ({MHV}) (50\% effective concentration [{EC50}] = 0.17 μM) and Middle East respiratory syndrome {CoV} ({MERS}-{CoV}) ({EC50} = 0.56 μM) with minimal cytotoxicity. {NHC} inhibited {MHV} lacking {ExoN} proofreading activity similarly to wild-type ({WT}) {MHV}, suggesting an ability to evade or overcome {ExoN} activity. {NHC} inhibited {MHV} only when added early during infection, decreased viral specific infectivity, and increased the number and proportion of G:A and C:U transition mutations present after a single infection. Low-level {NHC} resistance was difficult to achieve and was associated with multiple transition mutations across the genome in both {MHV} and {MERS}-{CoV}. These results point to a virus-mutagenic mechanism of {NHC} inhibition in {CoVs} and indicate a high genetic barrier to {NHC} resistance. Together, the data support further development of {NHC} for treatment of {CoVs} and suggest a novel mechanism of {NHC} interaction with the {CoV} replication complex that may shed light on critical aspects of replication.{IMPORTANCE} The emergence of coronaviruses ({CoVs}) into human populations from animal reservoirs has demonstrated their epidemic capability, pandemic potential, and ability to cause severe disease. However, no antivirals have been approved to treat these infections. Here, we demonstrate the potent antiviral activity of a broad-spectrum ribonucleoside analogue, \beta-d-N4-hydroxycytidine ({NHC}), against two divergent {CoVs}. Viral proofreading activity does not markedly impact sensitivity to {NHC} inhibition, suggesting a novel interaction between a nucleoside analogue inhibitor and the {CoV} replicase. Further, passage in the presence of {NHC} generates only low-level resistance, likely due to the accumulation of multiple potentially deleterious transition mutations. Together, these data support a mutagenic mechanism of inhibition by {NHC} and further support the development of {NHC} for treatment of {CoV} infections.

Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human {CoV} presenting a clear unmet medical need. Remdesivir ({RDV}, {GS}-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of {RNA} virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral {RNA} dependent {RNA} polymerase ({RdRp}). We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of {RDV} antiviral activity against the {CoV} family. Here, we show potent antiviral activity of {RDV} against endemic human {CoVs} {OC43} ({HCoV}-{OC43}) and {229E} ({HCoV}-{229E}) with submicromolar {EC50} values. Of known {CoVs}, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent {RdRp} as compared to {SARS}- and {MERS}-{CoV} and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the {RdRp} that confers resistance in beta-{CoVs}. Nevertheless, {RDV} is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus ({PDCoV}). These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of {RDV} to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic {CoV} and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging {CoV}.

abstract = {Despite widespread clinical use of antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}), systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}) and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases, insights into the mechanism of action of these drugs are still emerging. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are weak bases and have a characteristic 'deep' volume of distribution and a half-life of around 50 days. These drugs interfere with lysosomal activity and autophagy, interact with membrane stability and alter signalling pathways and transcriptional activity, which can result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of certain co-stimulatory molecules. These modes of action, together with the drug's chemical properties, might explain the clinical efficacy and well-known adverse effects (such as retinopathy) of these drugs. The unknown dose-response relationships of these drugs and the lack of definitions of the minimum dose needed for clinical efficacy and what doses are toxic pose challenges to clinical practice. Further challenges include patient non-adherence and possible context-dependent variations in blood drug levels. Available mechanistic data give insights into the immunomodulatory potency of hydroxychloroquine and provide the rationale to search for more potent and/or selective inhibitors.}

abstract = {Labile zinc, a tiny fraction of total intracellular zinc that is loosely bound to proteins and easily interchangeable, modulates the activity of numerous signaling and metabolic pathways. Dietary plant polyphenols such as the flavonoids quercetin ({QCT}) and epigallocatechin-gallate act as antioxidants and as signaling molecules. Remarkably, the activities of numerous enzymes that are targeted by polyphenols are dependent on zinc. We have previously shown that these polyphenols chelate zinc cations and hypothesized that these flavonoids might be also acting as zinc ionophores, transporting zinc cations through the plasma membrane. To prove this hypothesis, herein, we have demonstrated the capacity of {QCT} and epigallocatechin-gallate to rapidly increase labile zinc in mouse hepatocarcinoma Hepa 1-6 cells as well as, for the first time, in liposomes. In order to confirm that the polyphenols transport zinc cations across the plasma membrane independently of plasma membrane zinc transporters, {QCT}, epigallocatechin-gallate, or clioquinol ({CQ}), alone and combined with zinc, were added to unilamellar dipalmitoylphosphocholine/cholesterol liposomes loaded with membrane-impermeant {FluoZin}-3. Only the combinations of the chelators with zinc triggered a rapid increase of {FluoZin}-3 fluorescence within the liposomes, thus demonstrating the ionophore action of {QCT}, epigallocatechin-gallate, and {CQ} on lipid membrane systems. The ionophore activity of dietary polyphenols may underlay the raising of labile zinc levels triggered in cells by polyphenols and thus many of their biological actions.}

We have focused on identifying repurposing candidates for the transmembrane serine protease family member {II} ({TMPR\SS2}), which is critical for entry of coronaviruses into cells. Using known {3D} structures of close homologs, we created seven homology models. We also identified a set of serine protease inhibitor drugs, generated several conformations of each, and docked them into our models. We used three known chemical (non-drug) inhibitors and one validated inhibitor of {TMPR\SS2} in {MERS} as benchmark compounds and found six compounds with predicted high binding affinity in the range of the known inhibitors. We also showed that a previously published weak inhibitor, Camostat, had a significantly lower binding score than our six compounds. All six compounds are anticoagulants with significant and potentially dangerous clinical effects and side effects. Nonetheless, if these compounds significantly inhibit {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, they could represent a potentially useful clinical tool.}

In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans. Here we engineered full, partially deleted (-29 nt), and fully deleted {ORF8} into a {SARS}-{CoV} infectious {cDNA} clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for {SARS}-{CoV} replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which {SARS}-{CoV} is neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of {ORF8} (29 nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold. The effect was independent of the type I interferon response. The 29 nt deletion in {SARS}-{CoV} is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain. The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence. These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by {SARS}.}

In this study we confirmed the 3a protein expression and investigated its localization at the surface of {SARS}-{CoV}-infected or 3a-{cDNA}-transfected cells. Our experiments showed that recombinant 3a protein can form a homotetramer complex through interprotein disulfide bridges in 3a-{cDNA}-transfected cells, providing a clue to ion channel function. The putative ion channel activity of this protein was assessed in 3a-complement {RNA}-injected Xenopus oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp. The results suggest that 3a protein forms a potassium sensitive channel, which can be efficiently inhibited by barium. After {FRhK}-4 cells were transfected with an {siRNA}, which is known to suppress 3a expression, followed by infection with {SARS}-{CoV}, the released virus was significantly decreased, whereas the replication of the virus in the infected cells was not changed. Our observation suggests that {SARS}-{CoV} {ORF} 3a functions as an ion channel that may promote virus release. This finding will help to explain the highly pathogenic nature of {SARS}-{CoV} and to develop new strategies for treatment of {SARS} infection.}

Ampligen used i.p. at 10 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure also reduced virus lung titres to below detectable limits. Nelfinavir, beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, calpain inhibitor {VI}, 3-deazaneplanocin A and Alferon (human leukocyte {IFN}-alpha-n3) did not significantly reduce lung virus titres in mice. Anti-inflammatory agents, chloroquine, amodiaquin and pentoxifylline, were also inactive in vivo, suggesting that although they may be useful in ameliorating the hyperinflammatory response induced by the virus infection, they will not significantly reduce the replication of the virus, the inducer of inflammatory response. Thus, anti-inflammatory agents may only be useful in treating virus lung infections if used in combination with agents that inhibit virus replication. In summary, the data suggest that induction of {IFN} by mismatched {dsRNA} or actual treatment with exogenous {IFN}-alpha can inhibit {SARS}-{CoV} replication in the lungs of mice.}

Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of {COVID}-19.

In this study, we collected blood from {COVID}-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their {SARS}-{CoV}-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed {SARS}-{CoV}-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of {IgG} antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of {COVID}-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.}

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in {COVID}-19 patients remain largely unclear. {METHODS} We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, {CD4}+, {CD8}+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers {PD}-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 {COVID}-19 cases. {RESULTS} The number of total T cells, {CD4}+ and {CD8}+ T cells were dramatically reduced in {COVID}-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (≥60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}) care. Counts of total T cells, {CD8}+T cells or {CD4}+T cells lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, or 400/μL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum {IL}-6, {IL}-10 and {TNF}-\alpha concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced {IL}-6, {IL}-10 and {TNF}-\alpha concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from {COVID}-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker {PD}-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing {PD}-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. {CONCLUSIONS} T cell counts are reduced significantly in {COVID}-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-{ICU} patients, with total T cells, {CD8}+T cells {CD4}+T cells counts lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, and 400/μL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.}

While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect {SARS}-{CoV}-2 antibodies. Methods: Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ({ELISA}) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. These assays were developed with negative control samples representing pre-{COVID} 19 background immunity in the general population and samples from {COVID19} patients. Results: The assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of {COVID19} seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as 3 days post symptom onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling. Conclusion: Serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus {SARS}-Cov-2 antibody titers will also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.}

abstract = {An outbreak of the novel coronavirus {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the causative agent of {COVID}-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry ({AP}-{MS}), which identified 332 high confidence {SARS}-{CoV}-2-human protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing {FDA}-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.}

We previously showed that influenza virus M2 or encephalomyocarditis virus ({EMCV}) {2B} proteins stimulate {IL}-1\beta secretion following activation of the {NLRP3} inflammasome. However, the mechanism by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) activates the {NLRP3} inflammasome remains unknown. Here, we provide direct evidence that {SARS}-{CoV} 3a protein activates the {NLRP3} inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages. {SARS}-{CoV} 3a was sufficient to cause the {NLRP3} inflammasome activation. The ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated {IL}-1\beta secretion. While cells uninfected or infected with a lentivirus expressing a 3a protein defective in ion channel activity expressed {NLRP3} uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, {NLRP3} was redistributed to the perinuclear space in cells infected with a lentivirus expressing the 3a protein. K+ efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were important for {SARS}-{CoV} 3a-induced {NLRP3} inflammasome activation. These results highlight the importance of viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming viral proteins, in virus-induced {NLRP3} inflammasome activation.}

We have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of {SARS}-{CoV2} genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in {SARS}-{CoV} and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the {SARS}-{CoV2} genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein ({A930V} ({24351C\textgreaterT})) in the Indian {SARS}-{CoV2}, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-{miRNAs} may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host {miRNAs} which can potentially target {SARS}-{CoV2} genes. Interestingly, the nine {miRNAs} do not have targets in {SARS} and {MERS} genomes. Also, hsa-{miR}-27b is the only unique {miRNA} which has a target gene in the Indian {SARS}-{CoV2} genome. We also predicted immune epitopes in the genomes.}

We report the x-ray structures of the unliganded {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro and its complex with an \alpha-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. On the basis of the unliganded structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.

Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus ({CoV}) infections such as {MERS} and {SARS} in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for {MERS} and {SARS}. Most of the efforts for developing {CoV} vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter {COVID}-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter {COVID}-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier {SARS}- and {MERS}-{CoVs}, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.}

abstract = {{COVID}-19 is the most rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential. Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically {SARS} and {MERS}, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing over 45 million papers from the last 20 years. Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared to other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and drops drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention. Independent of the outcome of the current {COVID}-19 outbreak, we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field.}

Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) viral life cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved against {SARS}-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.

In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the causative agent of the ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against {SARS}-{CoV}-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type {III} interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of {COVID}-19.}

The {CoV} spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines. Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein and found that the {RBD} protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) receptors. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to {ACE2} receptor than {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD} and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} and {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD} to {ACE2}-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD}-specific antibodies could cross-react with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} protein, and {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD}-induced antisera could cross-neutralize {SARS}-{CoV}-2, suggesting the potential to develop {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD}-based vaccines for prevention of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV} infection.}

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions have been undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected {COVID}-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of {COVID}-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of {COVID}-19.

During signal transduction, molecular reactions and mechanisms occur in different spatial and temporal frames and involve feedbacks. This impedes the straight-forward use of methods based on Boolean networks, Bayesian approaches, and differential equations. We propose a new approach, {ProbRules}, that combines probabilities and logical rules to represent the dynamics of a system across multiple scales. We demonstrate that {ProbRules} models can represent various network motifs of biological systems. As an example of a comprehensive model of signal transduction, we provide a Wnt network that shows remarkable robustness under a range of phenotypical and pathological conditions. Its simulation allows the clarification of controversially discussed molecular mechanisms of Wnt signaling by predicting wet-lab measurements. {ProbRules} provides an avenue in current computational modeling by enabling systems biologists to integrate vast amounts of available data on different scales.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China. People of all ages are susceptible to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. No information on severe pediatric patients with {COVID}-19 has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with {COVID}-19. {METHODS}: We included eight severe or critically ill patients with {COVID}-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit ({ICU}), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe {COVID}-19. {RESULTS}: The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys. The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8). Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six. Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8). Other findings included decreased {CD16} + {CD56} (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased {CD3} (2/8), {CD4} (4/8) and {CD8} (1/8), {IL}-6 (2/8), {IL}-10 (5/8) and {IFN}-\gamma (2/8). Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in {ICU}, the other five recovered and were discharged home. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough. Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.}

Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 {RBD}-specific monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) derived from single B cells of eight {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infected individuals. These {mAbs} come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live {SARS}-{CoV}-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with {ACE2} receptor for {RBD} binding. Surprisingly, none of the {SARS} {CoV} 2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with {RBDs} from either {SARS} {CoV} or {MERS} {CoV} although substantial plasma cross reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} was found. These results suggest that antibody response to {RBDs} is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the {RBD}. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic {SARS}-{CoV}-2 interventions.}

abstract = {Zoonotic coronavirus ({CoV}) infections, like those responsible for the current {SARS}-{CoV}-2 epidemic, cause grave international public health concern. In infected cells, the {CoV} {RNA}-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle ({RO}). While double-membrane vesicles ({DMVs}) appear to be a pan -coronavirus {RO} element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional coronavirus-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which {RO} element(s) accommodate viral {RNA} synthesis. Here we provide detailed {2D} and {3D} analyses of {CoV} {ROs} and show that diverse {CoVs} essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules ({DMSs}) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-{CoV} infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized viral {RNA} followed by quantitative {EM} autoradiography revealed abundant viral {RNA} synthesis associated with {DMVs} in cells infected with the beta-{CoVs} {MERS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}, and the gamma-{CoV} infectious bronchitis virus. {RNA} synthesis could not be linked to {DMSs} or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the {CoV} {RO} and clearly establish {DMVs} as the central hub for viral {RNA} synthesis and a potential drug target in coronavirus infection.}

The {SARS} epidemic also brought new attention to the proteins translated from {ORF1a} and {ORF1b} of the input genome {RNA}, also known as the replicase/transcriptase gene. Evidence for change within the {ORF1ab} coding sequence during the {SARS} epidemic, as well as evidence from studies with other coronaviruses, indicates that it is likely that the {ORF1ab} proteins play roles in virus pathogenesis distinct from or in addition to functions directly involved in viral replication. Recent reverse genetic studies have confirmed that proteins of {ORF1ab} may be involved in cellular signaling and modification of cellular gene expression, as well as virulence by mechanisms yet to be determined. Thus, the evolution of the {ORF1ab} proteins may be determined as much by issues of host range and virulence as they are by specific requirements for intracellular replication.}

abstract = {Spatial organization is a characteristic of all cells, achieved in eukaryotic cells by utilizing both membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles. One of the key processes in eukaryotes is {RNA} splicing, which readies {mRNA} for translation. This complex and highly dynamical chemical process involves assembly and disassembly of many molecules in multiple cellular compartments and their transport among compartments. Our goal is to model the effect of spatial organization of membrane-less organelles (specifically nuclear speckles) and of organelle heterogeneity on splicing particle biogenesis in mammalian cells. Based on multiple sources of complementary experimental data, we constructed a spatial model of a {HeLa} cell to capture intracellular crowding effects. We then developed chemical reaction networks to describe the formation of {RNA} splicing machinery complexes and splicing processes within nuclear speckles (specific type of non-membrane-bound organelles). We incorporated these networks into our spatially-resolved human cell model and performed stochastic simulations for up to 15 minutes of biological time, the longest thus far for a eukaryotic cell. We find that an increase (decrease) in the number of nuclear pore complexes increases (decreases) the number of assembled splicing particles; and that compartmentalization is critical for the yield of correctly-assembled particles. We also show that a slight increase of splicing particle localization into nuclear speckles leads to a disproportionate enhancement of {mRNA} splicing and a reduction in the noise of generated {mRNA}. Our model also predicts that the distance between genes and speckles has a considerable effect on the {mRNA} production rate, with genes located closer to speckles producing {mRNA} at higher levels, emphasizing the importance of genome organization around speckles. The {HeLa} cell model, including organelles and sub-compartments, provides a flexible foundation to study other cellular processes that are strongly modulated by spatiotemporal heterogeneity.}

This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection2. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the identity of any intermediate host that might have facilitated transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of {SARS}-{CoV}-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of {SARS}-{CoV}-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.}

Data were collected until 28 February 2020. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. {RESULTS}: The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73\%) than in recovered patients (88; 55\%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48\%) and 16 (14\%)) than recovered patients (39 (24\%) and 7 (4\%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62\%), 55 (49\%), and 25 (22\%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31\%), 48 (30\%), and 1 (1\%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50\%) patients who died and 6 (4\%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91\%) and 76 (47\%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100\%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51\%), sepsis (113; 100\%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77\%), heart failure (41/83; 49\%), alkalosis (14/35; 40\%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37\%), acute kidney injury (28; 25\%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20\%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients. {CONCLUSION}: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19. \copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

abstract = {{COVID}-19 caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has recently affected over 200,000 people and killed more than 8000. Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in {COVID}-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during {COVID}-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from {COVID}-19. Compared with healthy control, {COVID}-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage ({ERS}). In {ERS} patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical {CD14}++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of {CD14}++{IL1B}+ monocytes. For nature killer ({NK}) cells and T cells, {CD4}+ T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while {NK} cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in {CD4}+ T memory cells and {CD8}+ T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and naïve B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor ({BCR}) changes (such as {IGHV1}-8 and {IGHV3}-7), and confirmed isotypes ({IGKV3}-11 and {IGHV3}-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, {IGHV3}-23+{IGHJ4}, indicated a monoclonal state associated with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that {IL}-{1B} and M-{CSF} may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and {TNFSF13}, {IL}-18 and {IL}-4 may be benefit for the recovery of {COVID}-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the {COVID}-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel {BCR} signaling may lead to the development of vaccine and antibodies for the treatment of {COVID}-19.}

abstract = {Summary Background The novel coronavirus ({CoV}) severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS})-{CoV}-2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countries. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2({ACE2}) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System ({RAS}), regulated by both {ACE} and {ACE2}, was altered in {COVID}-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor ({ACEI}) and Angiotensin {II} receptor blocker ({ARB}) shall be continued in the confirmed {COVID}-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between {COVID}-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included {COVID}-19 patients used {ACEI}, {ARB}, calcium channel blockers ({CCB}), beta blockers ({BB}), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 {COVID}-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs ({ACEI}, {ARB}, {CCB}, {BB}, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of {ACEI} and {ARB} associated with pneumonia using published studies. Findings Among the elderly (age\textgreater65) {COVID}-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of {COVID}-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took {ARB} drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs ({OR}=0.343, 95\% {CI} 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that {ARB} use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. Interpretation Elderly (age\textgreater65) {COVID}-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity who are taking {ARB} anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs.

abstract = {{COVID}-19 is caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2, and has become a global pandemic. There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific {IgG} and {IgM} responses. However, the {IgG}/ {IgM} responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 specific {IgG}/ {IgM} responses, a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the {IgG}/ {IgM} responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100\% of patients had {IgG}/ {IgM} responses to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate {COVID}-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to {ORF9b} and {NSP5} were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 {IgG} positively correlate to age and the level of {LDH} (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 {IgG} negatively correlate to Ly\% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 specific {IgG}/ {IgM} responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.}

Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat the infection. In this scenario, there is a need to utilize the existing repertoire of {FDA} approved drugs to treat the disease. The rational selection of these drugs could be made by testing their ability to inhibit any {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins essential for viral life-cycle. We chose one such crucial viral protein, the papain-like protease ({PLpro}), to screen the {FDA} approved drugs in silico. The homology model of the protease was built based on the {SARS}-coronavirus {PLpro} structure, and the drugs were docked in S3/S4 pockets of the active site of the enzyme. In our docking studies, sixteen {FDA} approved drugs, including chloroquine and formoterol, was found to bind the target enzyme with significant affinity and good geometry, suggesting their potential to be utilized against the virus.}

abstract = {Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality. It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 \textless 300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a {SARS}-{CoV}-2-specific antibody ({IgG}) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [{ELISA}]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from {COVID}-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ({SOFA}) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, {ARDS}, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ({ECMO}) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the {SOFA} score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and {SARS}-{CoV}-2-specific {ELISA} and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). {ARDS} resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with {COVID}-19 and {ARDS}, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.}

There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV}. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 or {SARS}-{CoV}, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding the antigenicity differences between {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV}, but also has important implications in vaccine development.}

abstract = {Importance: Increasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) are occurring in several countries and continents. Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with {COVID}-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with {COVID}-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T ({TnT}) levels. Result: Among 187 patients with confirmed {COVID}-19, 144 patients (77\%) were discharged and 43 patients (23\%) died. The mean ({SD}) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3\%) had underlying {CVD} including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8\%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated {TnT} levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62\% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying {CVD} and normal {TnT} levels, 13.33\% (4 of 30) for those with underlying {CVD} and normal {TnT} levels, 37.50\% (6 of 16) for those without underlying {CVD} but elevated {TnT} levels, and 69.44\% (25 of 36) for those with underlying {CVD} and elevated {TnTs}. Patients with underlying {CVD} were more likely to exhibit elevation of {TnT} levels compared with the patients without {CVD} (36 [54.5\%] vs 16 [13.2\%]). Plasma {TnT} levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (\beta = 0.530, P \textless  .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ({NT}-{proBNP}) levels (\beta = 0.613, P \textless  .001). Plasma {TnT} and {NT}-{proBNP} levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range ({IQR})], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [{IQR}], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [{IQR}], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P \textless  .001), while no significant dynamic changes of {TnT} (median [{IQR}], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and {NT}-{proBNP} (median [{IQR}], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated {TnT} levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2\%] vs 69 [51.1\%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6\%] vs 14 [10.4\%]) were higher compared with patients with normal {TnT} levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8\% (7 of 19) and 25.6\% (43 of 168). Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of {COVID}-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying {CVD} but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.}

This innovative and general procedure, based on the representation of the molecular iso-electron density surface in terms of {2D} Zernike polynomials, allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins, that was unfeasible with previous methods. We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the {ROC} curve of 0.69 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of {SARS}-Cov-2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.}

No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-{nCoV} virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-{nCoV}-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an {IC} 50 of 1.66 μM.

abstract = {Human Coronaviruses ({HCoVs}), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-{nCoV}. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the {HCoV}-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 {HCoV} whole genomes reveal that 2019-{nCoV} has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with {SARS}-{CoV} (79.7\%) among the six other known pathogenic {HCoVs}. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-{nCoV} are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96\% and 89.6\%, respectively, compared to {SARS}-{CoV}. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known {HCoV}-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of {HCoVs}. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-{HCoV} repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and {HCoV}-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the {HCoV}-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for {HCoVs}.}

The sequence identity of the {3CL} proteases of 2019-{nCoV} and {SARS} is 96\%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning ({SBDR}). Based on a {SARS} {3CL} protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a {3D} homology structure of 2019-{nCoV} {3CL} protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for {SARS} {3CL} protease inhibitors, we develop an {SBDR} model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the {DrugBank} that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}). We found that many {FDA} approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-{nCoV}.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the global spread of multidrug resistance in pathogenic microbes, infectious diseases emerge as a key public health concern of the recent time. Identification of host genes associated with infectious diseases will improve our understanding about the mechanisms behind their development and help to identify novel therapeutic targets. {RESULTS}: We developed a machine learning techniques-based classification approach to identify infectious disease-associated host genes by integrating sequence and protein interaction network features. Among different methods, Deep Neural Networks ({DNN}) model with 16 selected features for pseudo-amino acid composition ({PAAC}) and network properties achieved the highest accuracy of 86.33\% with sensitivity of 85.61\% and specificity of 86.57\%. The {DNN} classifier also attained an accuracy of 83.33\% on a blind dataset and a sensitivity of 83.1\% on an independent dataset. Furthermore, to predict unknown infectious disease-associated host genes, we applied the proposed {DNN} model to all reviewed proteins from the database. Seventy-six out of 100 highly-predicted infectious disease-associated genes from our study were also found in experimentally-verified human-pathogen protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}). Finally, we validated the highly-predicted infectious disease-associated genes by disease and gene ontology enrichment analysis and found that many of them are shared by one or more of the other diseases, such as cancer, metabolic and immune related diseases. {CONCLUSIONS}: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational method to identify infectious disease-associated host genes. The proposed method will help large-scale prediction of host genes associated with infectious-diseases. However, our results indicated that for small datasets, advanced {DNN}-based method does not offer significant advantage over the simpler supervised machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) or Random Forest ({RF}) for the prediction of infectious disease-associated host genes. Significant overlap of infectious disease with cancer and metabolic disease on disease and gene ontology enrichment analysis suggests that these diseases perturb the functions of the same cellular signaling pathways and may be treated by drugs that tend to reverse these perturbations. Moreover, identification of novel candidate genes associated with infectious diseases would help us to explain disease pathogenesis further and develop novel therapeutics.}

However, little is currently known about the biology of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Here, using {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ({hACE2}) is the receptor for {SARS}-{CoV}-2, find that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 enters 293/{hACE2} cells mainly through endocytosis, that {PIKfyve}, {TPC2}, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein is less stable than {SARS}-{CoV} S. Polyclonal anti-{SARS} S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of {SARS}-{CoV} S but not {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S pseudovirions. Further studies using recovered {SARS} and {COVID}-19 patients' sera show limited cross-neutralization, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The {SARS}-{CoV}-2-infected disease ({COVID}-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings. Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed {COVID}-19 cases with {GI} symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. {DESIGN}: {COVID}-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with {GI} symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 from Zhejiang province. {RESULTS}: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4\%) presented with at least one {GI} symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8\% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with {COVID}-19 with {GI} symptoms, 17 (22.97\%) and 23 (31.08\%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without {GI} symptoms, 47 (8.14\%) and 118 (20.45\%). Of patients with {COVID}-19 with {GI} symptoms, 29 (39.19\%), 23 (31.08\%), 8 (10.81\%) and 16 (21.62\%) had significantly higher rates of fever \textgreater38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86\% and 41.89\% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 with {m6A} methylation and changed binding capacity with {ACE2}. {CONCLUSION}: We report {COVID}-19 cases with {GI} symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. Attention to patients with {COVID}-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers. \copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under {CC} {BY}-{NC}.

In order to develop treatment options able to stop or ameliorate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 effects, we need to understand the biology of the virus inside cells, but this kind of studies are still scarce. A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by {SARS}-{CoV}-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated. The up-regulation of the inflammatory-related proteins observed could be linked to the propagation of inflammatory reaction and lung injury that is observed in advanced stages of {COVID}-19 patients.}

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the {nferX} platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell {RNA}-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues (https://academia.nferx.com/). Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of {COVID}-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor {ACE2}. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely under-appreciated targets of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, in addition to type {II} pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of {COVID}-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between {ACE2} and the other coronavirus receptors {DPP4} ({MERS}-{CoV}) and {ANPEP} (\alpha-coronavirus). This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.}

All such coronaviruses ({CoVs}) were confirmed to originate from bats. To continuously monitor the epidemic-related {CoVs} in bats, virome analysis was used to classify {CoVs} from 831 bats of 15 species in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Sichuan Provinces between August 2016 and May 2017. We identified 11 {CoV} strains from 22 individual samples of four bat species. Identification of four alpha-{CoVs} from Scotophilus kuhlii in Guangxi, which was closely related to a previously reported bat {CoV} and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ({PEDV}), revealed a bat-swine lineage under the genus Alphacoronavirus. A recombinant {CoV} showed that the {PEDV} probably originated from the {CoV} of S. kuhlii. Another alpha-{CoV}, \alpha-{YN2018}, from Rhinolophus affinis in Yunnan, suggested that this alpha-{CoV} lineage had multiple host origins, and \alpha-{YN2018} had recombined with {CoVs} of other bat species over time. We identified five {SARS}-related {CoVs} ({SARSr}-{CoVs}) in Rhinolophus bats from Sichuan and Yunnan and confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 usable {SARSr}-{CoVs} were continuously circulating in Rhinolophus spp. in Yunnan. The other beta-{CoV}, strain \beta-{GX2018}, found in Cynopterus sphinx of Guangxi, represented an independently evolved lineage different from known {CoVs} of Rousettus and Eonycteris bats. The identification of diverse {CoVs} here provides new genetic data for understanding the distribution and source of pathogenic {CoVs} in China.}

abstract = {Bats and rodents are recognized to host a great diversity of viruses and several important viral zoonoses, but how this viral diversity is structured and how viruses are connected, shared and distributed among host networks is not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the associative capacity of the host-virus networks in rodents and bats with the identification of those viruses with zoonotic potential. A virus database, detected by molecular methods, was constructed in the two taxonomic groups. We compiled 5,484 records: 825 in rodents and 4,659 in bats. We identified a total of 173 and 166 viruses, of which 53 and 40 are zoonotic viruses, in rodents and bats, respectively. Based on a network theory, a non-directed bipartite host-virus network was built for each group. Subsequently, the networks were collapsed to represent the connections among hosts and viruses. We identified both discrete and connected communities. We observed a greater degree of connectivity in bat viruses and more discrete communities in rodents. The Coronaviridae recorded in bats have the highest values of degree, betweenness and closeness centralities. In rodents, higher degree positions were distributed homogeneously between viruses and hosts. At least in our database, a higher proportion of rodent viruses were zoonotic. Rodents should thus not be underestimated as important reservoirs of zoonotic disease. We found that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than in rodents. Network theory can reveal some macroecological patterns and identify risks that were previously unrecognized. For example, we found that parvovirus in megabats and Gbagroube virus in rodents may represent a zoonotic risk due to the proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses. We propose that epidemiological surveillance programmes should consider the connectivity of network actors as a measure of the risks of dispersion and transmission. \copyright 2019 Blackwell Verlag {GmbH}.}

Here we present direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed {sgRNAs} are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq enables detection of multiple distinct {sgRNA} sequences from individual cells and thus allows pooled single-cell {CRISPR} screens to be easily paired with combinatorial perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic interactions and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between cholesterol biogenesis and {DNA} repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also show that targeting individual genes with multiple {sgRNAs} per cell improves efficacy of {CRISPR} interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly active {CRISPR} libraries for single-cell screens.

abstract = {A new type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus {SARS}-{CoV}-2 outbreaks recently in China and spreads into many other countries. This disease, named as {COVID}-19, is similar to patients infected by {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}, and nearly 20\% of patients developed severe condition. Cardiac injury is a prevalent complication of severe patients, exacerbating the disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), the key host cellular receptor of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, has been identified in multiple organs, but its cellular distribution in human heart is not illuminated clearly. This study performed the first state-of-art single cell atlas of adult human heart, and revealed that pericytes with high expression of {ACE2} might act as the target cardiac cell of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The pericytes injury due to virus infection may result in capillary endothelial cells dysfunction, inducing microvascular dysfunction. And patients with basic heart failure disease showed increased {ACE2} expression at both {mRNA} and protein levels, meaning that if infected by the virus these patients may have higher risk of heart attack and critically ill condition. The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among {COVID}-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury among severe patients infected by {SARS}-{CoV}-2.

abstract = {Coronaviruses infect many species of animals including humans, causing acute and chronic diseases. This review focuses primarily on the pathogenesis of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus ({MHV}) and severe acute respiratory coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}). {MHV} is a collection of strains, which provide models systems for the study of viral tropism and pathogenesis in several organs systems, including the central nervous system, the liver, and the lung, and has been cited as providing one of the few animal models for the study of chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. {SARS}-{CoV} emerged in the human population in China in 2002, causing a worldwide epidemic with severe morbidity and high mortality rates, particularly in older individuals. We review the pathogenesis of both viruses and the several reverse genetics systems that made much of these studies possible. We also review the functions of coronavirus proteins, structural, enzymatic, and accessory, with an emphasis on roles in pathogenesis. Structural proteins in addition to their roles in virion structure and morphogenesis also contribute significantly to viral spread in vivo and in antagonizing host cell responses. Nonstructural proteins include the small accessory proteins that are not at all conserved between {MHV} and {SARS}-{CoV} and the 16 conserved proteins encoded in the replicase locus, many of which have enzymatic activities in {RNA} metabolism or protein processing in addition to functions in antagonizing host response.

abstract = {A dysregulated innate immune response and exuberant cytokine/chemokine expression are believed to be critical factors in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}), caused by a coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}). However, we recently showed that inefficient immune activation and a poor virus-specific T cell response underlie severe disease in {SARS}-{CoV}-infected mice. Here, we extend these results to show that virus-specific T cells, in the absence of activation of the innate immune response, were sufficient to significantly enhance survival and diminish clinical disease. We demonstrated that T cells are responsible for virus clearance, as intravenous adoptive transfer of {SARS}-{CoV}-immune splenocytes or in vitro-generated T cells to {SCID} or {BALB}/c mice enhanced survival and reduced virus titers in the lung. Enhancement of the number of virus-specific {CD8} T cells by immunization with {SARS}-{CoV} peptide-pulsed dendritic cells also resulted in a robust T cell response, earlier virus clearance, and increased survival. These studies are the first to show that T cells play a crucial role in {SARS}-{CoV} clearance and that a suboptimal T cell response contributes to the pathological changes observed in {SARS}. They also provide a new approach to {SARS} vaccine design.}

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate {COVID}-19.{METHODSIn} this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with {COVID}-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.{RESULTSThe} median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of {IL}-{2R}, {IL}-6, {IL}-10, and {TNF}-\alpha. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, {CD4}+ T cells, and {CD8}+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106/L, respectively). The expression of {IFN}-\gamma by {CD4}+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1\%) than in moderate cases (22.8\%).{CONCLUSIONThe} {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly {CD4}+ and {CD8}+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as {IFN}-\gamma production by {CD4}+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in {COVID}-19.{TRIAL} {REGISTRATIONThis} is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.{FUNDINGThis} work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease ({2017ZX10202201}).}

A key to tackling this pandemic is to understand the receptor recognition mechanism of the virus, which regulates its infectivity, pathogenesis and host range. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV} recognize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2})-in humans3,4. Here we determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) of the spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex with {ACE2}. In comparison with the {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD}, an {ACE2}-binding ridge in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} has a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the {RBD}-{ACE2} interface. These structural features of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} increase its {ACE2}-binding affinity. Additionally, we show that {RaTG13}, a bat coronavirus that is closely related to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, also uses human {ACE2} as its receptor. The differences among {SARS}-{CoV}-2, {SARS}-{CoV} and {RaTG13} in {ACE2} recognition shed light on the potential animal-to-human transmission of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. This study provides guidance for intervention strategies that target receptor recognition by {SARS}-{CoV}-2.}

Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with {COVID}-19, and serum antibody responses. {METHODS}: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed {COVID}-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative {PCR} ({RT}-{qPCR}). Antibody levels against the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 internal nucleoprotein ({NP}) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain ({RBD}) were measured using {EIA}. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. {FINDINGS}: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37-75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per {mL} ({IQR} 4·1-7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0·15, 95\% {CI} -0·19 to -0·11; R2=0·71). In one patient, viral {RNA} was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \rho=0·48, 95\% {CI} 0·074-0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94\% for anti-{NP} {IgG} (n=15), 88\% for anti-{NP} {IgM} (n=14), 100\% for anti-{RBD} {IgG} (n=16), and 94\% for anti-{RBD} {IgM} (n=15). Anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2-{NP} or anti-{SARS}-{CoV}-2-{RBD} {IgG} levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2\textgreater0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. {INTERPRETATION}: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with {COVID}-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement {RT}-{qPCR} for diagnosis. {FUNDING}: Richard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy Service, and Sanming Project of Medicine.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. {METHODS}: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from {COVID}-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of {PCR}-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. {FINDINGS}: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95\% credible interval [{CrI}] 16·9-19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9-28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67\% (95\% {CrI} 3·56-3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38\% (1·23-1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32\% [0·27-0·38] in those aged \textless 60 years vs 6·4\% [5·7-7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4\% (11·2-15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4\% [0·4-3·5] in those aged \textless 60 years [n=360] and 4·5\% [1·8-11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66\% (0·39-1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4\% (11·0-7·6) in those aged 80 years or older. {INTERPRETATION}: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of {COVID}-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death. {FUNDING}: {UK} Medical Research Council.

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8\% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1\% of cases with critical courses3. This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity-but also aided in the control-of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) in 20035. However, there are reports of cases of {COVID}-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6-8. There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of {COVID}-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 × 108 {RNA} copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples-in spite of high concentrations of virus {RNA}. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative {RNA} intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral {RNA} from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50\% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. {COVID}-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of {COVID}-19.}

abstract = {On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) a pandemic (1). As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed {COVID}-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide (2). Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe {COVID}-19-associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. {COVID}-19 patients have not yet been reported (5). As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. {COVID}-19 cases to {CDC}, including 7,162 (5.8\%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6\%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4\%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of {COVID}-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit ({ICU}) admission (358 of 457, 78\%) and those requiring hospitalization without {ICU} admission (732 of 1,037, 71\%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27\%). The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from {COVID}-19 than are persons without these conditions.}

We sought to analyse the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of some cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia . {METHODS}: In this retrospective study, we extracted the data on 95 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from January 16th to February 25th, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time {RT}-{PCR} and abnormal radiologic findings.

We analyse the composite endpoints, which consisted of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. {RESULTS}: The mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7\%) were females. Severe cases accounted for 16.0\% of the study population. 131 (8.2\%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1\%) reported having at least one comorbidity.

Here, to better understand the initial step of infection at an atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) of the spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 bound to the cell receptor {ACE2}. The overall {ACE2}-binding mode of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} is nearly identical to that of the {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD}, which also uses {ACE2} as the cell receptor4. Structural analysis identified residues in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD} that are essential for {ACE2} binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the {SARS}-{CoV} {RBD}. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly indicate convergent evolution between the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV} {RBDs} for improved binding to {ACE2}, although {SARS}-{CoV}-2 does not cluster within {SARS} and {SARS}-related coronaviruses1-3,5. The epitopes of two {SARS}-{CoV} antibodies that target the {RBD} are also analysed for binding to the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD}, providing insights into the future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.}

Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific {IgG} and {IgM} antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses.

The virus is a positive-strand {RNA} virus with high homology to bat coronavirus. In this study, conserved domain analysis, homology modeling, and molecular docking were used to compare the biological roles of certain proteins of the novel coronavirus. The results showed the {ORF8} and surface glycoprotein could bind to the porphyrin, respectively. At the same time, orf1ab, {ORF10}, and {ORF3a} proteins could coordinate attack the heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin to dissociate the iron to form the porphyrin. The attack will cause less and less hemoglobin that can carry oxygen and carbon dioxide. The lung cells have extremely intense poisoning and inflammatory due to the inability to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen frequently, which eventually results in ground-glass-like lung images. The mechanism also interfered with the normal heme anabolic pathway of the human body, is expected to result in human disease. According to the validation analysis of these finds, chloroquine could prevent orf1ab, {ORF3a}, and {ORF10} to attack the heme to form the porphyrin, and inhibit the binding of {ORF8} and surface glycoproteins to porphyrins to a certain extent, effectively relieve the symptoms of respiratory distress. Favipiravir could inhibit the envelope protein and {ORF7a} protein bind to porphyrin, prevent the virus from entering host cells, and catching free porphyrins. Because the novel coronavirus is dependent on porphyrins, it may originate from an ancient virus. Therefore, this research is of high value to contemporary biological experiments, disease prevention, and clinical treatment.}

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of {SARS}-{CoV}. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-{HB}) core of the {HR1} and {HR2} domains in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the {HR1} domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the {HR2} domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, {EK1}, which targeted the {HR1} domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from {EK1} and found that {EK1C4} was the most potent fusion inhibitor against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with {IC50s} of 1.3 and 15.8 {nM}, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original {EK1} peptide, respectively. {EK1C4} was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}, as well as {SARSr}-{CoVs}, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Intranasal application of {EK1C4} before or after challenge with {HCoV}-{OC43} protected mice from infection, suggesting that {EK1C4} could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and other emerging {SARSr}-{CoVs}.}

abstract = {The impact of respiratory virus infections on the health of children and adults can be very significant. Yet, in contrast to most other childhood infections as well as other viral and bacterial diseases, prophylactic vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against viral respiratory infections are either still not available, or provide only limited protection. Given the widespread prevalence, a general lack of natural sterilizing immunity, and/or high morbidity and lethality rates of diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, this difficult situation is a genuine societal challenge. A thorough understanding of the virus-host interactions during these respiratory infections will most probably be pivotal to ultimately meet these challenges. This review attempts to provide a comparative overview of the knowledge about an important part of the interaction between respiratory viruses and their host: the arms race between host innate immunity and viral innate immune evasion. Many, if not all, viruses, including the respiratory viruses listed above, suppress innate immune responses to gain a window of opportunity for efficient virus replication and setting-up of the infection. The consequences for the host's immune response are that it is often incomplete, delayed or diminished, or displays overly strong induction (after the delay) that may cause tissue damage. The affected innate immune response also impacts subsequent adaptive responses, and therefore viral innate immune evasion often undermines fully protective immunity. In this review, innate immune responses relevant for respiratory viruses with an {RNA} genome will briefly be summarized, and viral innate immune evasion based on shielding viral {RNA} species away from cellular innate immune sensors will be discussed from different angles. Subsequently, viral enzymatic activities that suppress innate immune responses will be discussed, including activities causing host shut-off and manipulation of stress granule formation. Furthermore, viral protease-mediated immune evasion and viral manipulation of the ubiquitin system will be addressed. Finally, perspectives for use of the reviewed knowledge for the development of novel antiviral strategies will be sketched. \copyright 2019 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger {AG}, Basel.}

abstract = {The innate immune system is the first line of defense against virus infection that triggers the expression of type I interferon ({IFN}) and proinflammatory cytokines. Pattern recognition receptors ({PRRs}) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, resulting in the induction of innate immune responses. Viral {RNA} in endosomes is recognized by Toll-like receptors, and cytoplasmic viral {RNA} is recognized by {RIG}-I-like receptors. The host innate immune response is critical for protection against virus infection. However, it has been postulated that an excessive inflammatory response in the lung caused by the innate immune response is harmful to the host and is a cause of lethality during influenza A virus infection. Although the deletion of genes encoding {PRRs} or proinflammatory cytokines does not improve the mortality of mice infected with influenza A virus, a partial block of the innate immune response is successful in decreasing the mortality rate of mice without a loss of protection against virus infection. In addition, morbidity and mortality rates are influenced by other factors. For example, secondary bacterial infection increases the mortality rate in patients with influenza A virus and in animal models of the disease, and environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke and fine particles, also affect the innate immune response. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to the role of {PRRs} in innate immune response during respiratory viral infection.}

abstract = {Up to 75 \% of emerging human diseases are zoonoses, spread from animals to humans. Although bacteria, fungi and parasites can be causative agents, the majority of zoonotic infections are caused by viral pathogens. During the past 20 years many factors have converged to cause a dramatic resurgence or emergence of zoonotic diseases. Some of these factors include demographics, social changes, urban sprawl, changes in agricultural practices and global climate changes. In the period between 2014-2017 zoonotic viruses including ebola virus ({EBOV}), chikungunya virus ({CHIKV}), dengue virus ({DENV}) and zika virus ({ZIKV}), caused prominent outbreaks resulting in significant public health and economic burdens, especially in developing areas where these diseases are most prevalent. When a viral pathogen invades a new human host, it is the innate immune system that serves as the first line of defence. Myeloid cells are especially important to help fight viral infections, including those of zoonotic origins. However, viruses such as {EBOV}, {CHIKV}, {DENV} and {ZIKV} have evolved mechanisms that allow circumvention of the host's innate immune response, avoiding eradication and leading to severe clinical disease. Herein, the importance of myeloid cells in host defence is discussed and the mechanisms by which these viruses exploit myeloid cells are highlighted. The insights provided in this review will be invaluable for future studies looking to identify potential therapeutic targets towards the treatment of these emerging diseases.}

However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 ({HCoV}-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the {RNAs} isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ({BALF}) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) specimens of {COVID}-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between {COVID}-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as {CCL2}/{MCP}-1, {CXCL10}/{IP}-10, {CCL3}/{MIP}-{1A}, and {CCL4}/{MIP1B}. Furthermore, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of {COVID}-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.}

Unfortunately, this knowledge is mostly embedded in the literature in such a way that it is unavailable for automated data analysis procedures. Biological expression language ({BEL}) is a syntax representation allowing for the structured representation of a broad range of biological relationships. It is used in various situations to extract such knowledge and transform it into {BEL} networks. To support the tedious and time-intensive extraction work of curators with automated methods, we developed the {BEL} track within the framework of {BioCreative} Challenges. Within the {BEL} track, we provide training data and an evaluation environment to encourage the text mining community to tackle the automatic extraction of complex {BEL} relationships. In 2017 {BioCreative} {VI}, the 2015 {BEL} track was repeated with new test data. Although only minor improvements in text snippet retrieval for given statements were achieved during this second {BEL} task iteration, a significant increase of {BEL} statement extraction performance from provided sentences could be seen. The best performing system reached a 32\% F-score for the extraction of complete {BEL} statements and with the given named entities this increased to 49\%. This time, besides rule-based systems, new methods involving hierarchical sequence labeling and neural networks were applied for {BEL} statement extraction. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

abstract = {Recently a novel coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) emerged from Wuhan, China and has infected more than 571000 people leading to more than 26000 deaths. Since {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of {SARS}, we sought to analyze all the available {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from {SARS} genome specifically focusing on non-coding {RNAs}. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded {miRNAs} that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded {miRNAs} that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded {miRNAs} that could target the genome of both the viruses ({SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS} reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host {miRNAs} that could target {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome as compared to the {SARS} reference genome. Results from second approach involving {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS} reference genome identified a set of virus encoded {miRNAs} which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar {GA} rich motif in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe {SARS} infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded {miRNAs} that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host {miRNAs} could target {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards {SARS} pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.}

Based on the {NCBI} Reference Sequence: {NC\_045512}.2, the conformational and linear B cell epitopes of the surface protein were predicted separately by various prediction methods. Furthermore, the conservation of the epitopes, the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed. 7 epitopes were predicted, including 5 linear epitopes and 2 conformational epitopes, one of the linear and one of the conformational were coincide. The epitope D mutated easily, but the other epitopes were very conservative and the epitope C was the most conservative. It is worth mentioning that all of the 6 dominated epitopes were absolutely conservative in nearly 1000 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes, and they deserved further study. The findings would facilitate the vaccine development, had the potential to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease, but also have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of coronavirus.}

We fortuitously found that {C3A} was more susceptible to human coronavirus {HCoV}-{OC43} infection than {HepG2}, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into {C3A} cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to {HCoV}-{OC43} infection, we found that {ADAP2}, {GILT} and {LY6E}, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in {HepG2} cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of {LY6E}, but not {GILT} or {ADAP2}, in {HEK} 293 cells inhibited the entry of {HCoV}-{OC43}. While overexpression of {LY6E} in {C3A} and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of {HCoV}-{OC43}, knockdown of {LY6E} expression in {HepG2} significantly increased its susceptibility to {HCoV}-{OC43} infection. Moreover, we found that {LY6E} also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease {TMPR\SS2} or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the {IFITM3} restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of {LY6E} on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that {LY6E} is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls {CoV} infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.}

Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography ({CT}) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest {CT}; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation ({SPO2}) in patients. {RESULTS}: Chest {CT} revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7\%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4\%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1\%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3\%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3\%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4\%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1\%). {CT} results showed a negative correlation with {SPO2} and lymphocyte numbers (p\textless 0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: Spiral {CT} is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.

This does not fully utilize the transmission flexibility and efficiently address network congestion. A dynamic network can provide a lower optimal cost and alleviate network congestion. However, due to the computational complexity and the lack of effective algorithms, network reconfiguration has not been included in the {SCUC} model yet. This paper emphasizes the usage of corrective network reconfiguration ({CNR}) in response to a contingency while meeting realistic solve time for large-scale power system networks. An enhanced Benders decomposition approach is proposed to model and solve a co-optimized N-1 {SCUC} with {CNR}. The proposed method is tested and validated on the {IEEE} 24-bus system where it leads to overall cost saving and substantial congestion alleviation in post-contingency scenarios. The proposed method is also tested on the {IEEE} 73-bus system and Polish system to show the scalability.}

Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.}

abstract = {{SARS}-coronavirus 2 is the causal agent of the {COVID}-19 outbreak. {SARS}-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. {CTSL}/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.{CTSL} disruption offers potential for {CoVID}-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of {CTSL}, direct inhibition of {CTSL} activity and affecting the conditions of {CTSL} environment (increase {pH} in lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of {CTSL}/{CTSB}. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the {CTSL} gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the {US} Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating {CTSL} appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway , hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the {CTSL} functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in {COVID}-19 infection.}

With additional informative priors from epidemiological models, bounds can be put on the true number of infected, permitting direct inference of covariates on the unseen infection rate. This retrospective model is useful for researchers in fields who are collecting increasing amounts of data about contextual factors, like government policies and political partisanship, that are related to the virus but who have no need or interest in forecasting the disease's spread. To apply the model, I show that as of March 30th, U.S. states with higher rates of cardiovascular deaths are associated with more rapidly rising {COVID}-19 infection rates, while a state's vote share for Donald Trump in the 2016 election is not.}

In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number R0 Without self-isolation, when R0 = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more {ICU} beds than exist in the United States. Self-isolation by 20\% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of {ICU} beds needed at the peak by 48.4\% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3\%), although still exceeding existing capacity. When R0 = 2, twice as many {ICU} beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation. In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of {ICU} beds is substantially higher at 73.5\% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3\%). Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak. Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.

abstract = {This article reviews the correlation between {ACE2} and severe risk factors for {COVID}-19 and the possible mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}). The classical {RAS} {ACE}-Ang {II}-{AT1R} regulatory axis and the {ACE2}-Ang1-7-{MasR} counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. {ACE2} is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. {ACE2} antagonizes the activation of the classical {RAS} system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Similar to {SARS}-{CoV}, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 also uses the {ACE2} receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. {ARDS} is a clinical high-mortality disease, and {ACE2} has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with {COVID}-19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (higher than 60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary {ARDS}, and other relevant factors. Because of these protective effects of {ACE2} on chronic underlying diseases and {ARDS}, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing {ACE2} activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of {COVID}-19 in the future.

abstract = {Mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. These disorders share underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) that may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic {RAS} inhibition both increase {ACE2} levels, which may increase the virulence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection may downregulate {ACE2}, leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin {II} that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. {RAS} inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of {RAS} inhibition in {COVID}-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When {COVI}-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin ({IL})-1\beta and {IL}-6. The binding of {COVI}-19 to the Toll Like Receptor ({TLR}) causes the release of pro-{IL}-1\beta which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature {IL}-1\beta which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory {IL}-1 family members and {IL}-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine {IL}-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on {IL}-{18R\alpha} receptor. {IL}-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on {mTOR} and increasing the adenosine monophosphate ({AMP}) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class {II} histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing {MyD88} and subsequently {IL}-1\beta, {IL}-6, {TNF} and {CCL2}. The suppression of {IL}-1\beta by {IL}-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is {IL}-38, the newest cytokine of the {IL}-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. {IL}-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits {IL}-1\beta and other pro-inflammatory {IL}-family members. {IL}-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by coronavirus-19, providing a new relevant strategy.}

The virus knowledge is limited and especially about {COVID}-2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab ({ORF1ab}) of {COVID}-2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast-unconstrained Bayesian approximation ({FUBAR}) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by {SwissModel} and {HHPred} servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus {ORF1ab} non structural protein 2 (nsp2) and nsp3 was tested by {TMHMM}, {MEMSAT}, and {MEMPACK} tools. Three-dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using {PyMOL}. {FUBAR} analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (P \textless  .05). Position 723 in the {COVID}-2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (P \textless  .05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55\%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) and Bat {SARS}-like {CoV}. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for {COVID}-2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating {COVID}-2019 from {SARS}. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen. \copyright 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

abstract = {Pandemics, even more than other scientific questions, require swift integration of knowledge and identifiers. In a setting where there is a large number of loosely connected projects and initiatives, we need a common ground, also known as a "commons". Wikidata, a public knowledge graph aligned with Wikipedia, is such a commons, but Wikidata may not always have the right schema for the urgent questions. In this paper, we address this problem by showing how a data schema required for the integration can be modelled with entity schemas represented by shape expressions. As a telling example, we describe the process of aligning resources on the genomics of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus and related viruses as well as how shape expressions can be defined for Wikidata helping others studying the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic. How this model can be used to make data between various resources interoperable, is demonstrated by integrating data from {NCBI} Taxonomy, {NCBI} Genes, {UniProt}, and {WikiPathways}. Based on that model, a set of automated applications or bots were written for regular updates of these sources in Wikidata and added to a platform for automatically running these updates. Although this workflow is developed and applied in the context of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic, it was also applied to other human coronaviruses ({MERS}, {SARS}, {SARS}-{CoV}-2, Human Coronavirus {NL63}, Human coronavirus {229E}, Human coronavirus {HKU1}, Human coronavirus {OC4}) to demonstrate its broader applicability.}

abstract = {{COVID}-19 has quickly become a worldwide pandemic, which has significantly impacted the economy, education, and social interactions. Understanding the humoral antibody response to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat {COVID}-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is \~2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/{mL}. Here, the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for {SARS}-{CoV}-1 proteins can also target {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in {COVID}-19 research. Second, {IgM} and {IgG} immunogenic epitopes of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten {COVID}-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to {COVID}-19 and are potential targets for {COVID}-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the {ACE2} receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is warranted. Antibody and epitope profiling in response to {COVID}-19 is possible with our peptide-based {SARS}-{COV}-2 proteome microarray. The data gleaned from the array could provide invaluable information to the scientific community to understand, detect, and treat {COVID}-19.}

Nsp9 forms a dimer through the interaction of parallel alpha-helices containing the protein-protein interaction motif {GXXXG}. In order to study the role of the nsp9 dimer in viral reproduction, residues G100 and G104 at the helix interface were targeted for mutation. Multi-angle light scattering measurements indicated that {G100E}, {G104E}, and {G104V} mutants are monomeric in solution, thereby disrupting the dimer. However, electrophoretic mobility assays revealed that the mutants bound {RNA} with similar affinity. Further experiments using fluorescence anisotropy showed a 10-fold reduction in {RNA} binding in the {G100E} and {G104E} mutants, whereas the {G104V} mutant had only a 4-fold reduction. The structure of {G104E} nsp9 was determined to 2.6-A resolution, revealing significant changes at the dimer interface. The nsp9 mutations were introduced into {SARS}-{CoV} using a reverse genetics approach, and the {G100E} and {G104E} mutations were found to be lethal to the virus. The {G104V} mutant produced highly debilitated virus and eventually reverted back to the wild-type protein sequence through a codon transversion. Together, these data indicate that dimerization of {SARS}-{CoV} nsp9 at the {GXXXG} motif is not critical for {RNA} binding but is necessary for viral replication.}

It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve {HCoV}-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that {DIP} supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of {DIP} treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60\%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100\%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving {DIP} passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, {HCoV}-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from {DIP} adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of {DIP} are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.}

Additional host molecules including {ADAM17}, cathepsin L, {CD147}, and {GRP78} may also function as receptors for {SARS}-{CoV}-2. To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the {FANTOM5} dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNAseq}) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples. We demonstrate absent to low {ACE2} promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low {ACE2} gene expression in both microarray and {scRNAseq} datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare {ACE2} protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of {TMPR\SS2}, {CD147}, and {GRP78} protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of {CD147} in the respiratory mucosa. Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating {ACE2} expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.}

abstract = {Background: {COVID}-19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its first detection in China in December, 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known. Methods: Available data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination. Results: All the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan ({MT192759}) which is 100\% identical with the ancestor {SARS}-{CoV}-2 sequences of Wuhan ({NC} 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T ({C\textgreaterT}) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations {A\textgreaterT}, {G\textgreaterA}, {T\textgreaterA} are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body. Interpretation: The fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal (L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain (I).}

abstract = {Ligand-receptor systems, covalent modification cycles, and transcriptional networks are basic units of signaling systems and their steady-state properties are well understood. However, the behavior of such systems before steady-state is poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed the properties of input-output curves for each of these systems as they approach steady-state. In ligand-receptor systems, the {EC50} (concentration of the ligand that occupies 50\% of the receptors) is higher before the system reaches steady-state. Based on this behavior, we have previously defined {PRE\SS} (for pre-equilibrium sensing and signaling), a general "systems level" mechanism cells may use to overcome input saturation. Originally, we showed that, given a step stimulation, {PRE\SS} operates when the kinetics of ligand-receptor binding are slower than the downstream signaling steps. Now, we show that, provided the input increases slowly, it is not essential for the ligand binding reaction itself to be slow. In addition, we demonstrate that covalent modification cycles and gene expression systems may also operate in {PRE\SS} mode. Thus, nearly all biochemical processes may operate in {PRE\SS} mode, suggesting that this mechanism may be ubiquitous in cell signaling systems.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The molecular changes induced by perturbations such as drugs and ligands are highly informative of the intracellular wiring. Our capacity to generate large data-sets is increasing steadily as new experimental approaches are developed. A useful way to extract mechanistic insight from the data is by integrating them with a prior knowledge network of signalling to obtain dynamic models. Logic models scale better with network size than alternative kinetic models, while keeping the interpretation of the model simple, making them particularly suitable for large datasets. {RESULTS}: {CellNOpt} is a collection of Bioconductor R packages for building logic models from perturbation data and prior knowledge of signalling networks. We have recently developed new components and refined the existing ones. These updates include (i) an Integer Linear Programming ({ILP}) formulation which guarantees efficient optimisation for Boolean models, (ii) a probabilistic logic implementation for semi-quantitative datasets and (iii) the integration of {MaBo\SS}, a stochastic Boolean simulator. Furthermore, we introduce Dynamic-Feeder, a tool to identify missing links not present in the prior knowledge. We have also implemented systematic post-hoc analyses to highlight the key components and parameters of our models. Finally, we provide an R-Shiny tool to run {CellNOpt} interactively. {AVAILABILITY}: R-package(s): https://github.com/saezlab/cellnopt {CONTACT}: julio.saez@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplemental Text.}

However, existing modelling tools are often computation-heavy and do not offer intuitive ways to explore the model, to test hypotheses or to interpret the results biologically. Results: We have developed a computational approach to contextualize logical models of regulatory networks with biological measurements based on a probabilistic description of rule-based interactions between the different molecules. Here, we propose a Matlab toolbox, {FALCON}, to automatically and efficiently build and contextualize networks, which includes a pipeline for conducting parameter analysis, knockouts and easy and fast model investigation. The contextualized models could then provide qualitative and quantitative information about the network and suggest hypotheses about biological processes.

abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause infections in the human respiratory tract and give rise to annual seasonal outbreaks, as well as more rarely dreaded pandemics. Influenza A viruses become quickly resistant to the virus-directed antiviral treatments, which are the current main treatment options. A promising alternative approach is to target host cell factors that are exploited by influenza viruses. To this end, we characterized the phosphoproteome of influenza A virus infected primary human macrophages to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways and critical host factors activated upon influenza infection. We identified 1675 phosphoproteins, 4004 phosphopeptides and 4146 nonredundant phosphosites. The phosphorylation of 1113 proteins (66\%) was regulated upon infection, highlighting the importance of such global phosphoproteomic profiling in primary cells. Notably, 285 of the identified phosphorylation sites have not been previously described in publicly available phosphorylation databases, despite many published large-scale phosphoproteome studies using human and mouse cell lines. Systematic bioinformatics analysis of the phosphoproteome data indicated that the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (such as {TRIM22} and {TRIM25}) and antiviral responses (such as {MAVS}) changed in infected macrophages. Proteins known to play roles in small {GTPase}-, mitogen-activated protein kinase-, and cyclin-dependent kinase- signaling were also regulated by phosphorylation upon infection. In particular, the influenza infection had a major influence on the phosphorylation profiles of a large number of cyclin-dependent kinase substrates. Functional studies using cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors showed that the cyclin-dependent kinase activity is required for efficient viral replication and for activation of the host antiviral responses. In addition, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors protect {IAV}-infected mice from death. In conclusion, we provide the first comprehensive phosphoproteome characterization of influenza A virus infection in primary human macrophages, and provide evidence that cyclin-dependent kinases represent potential therapeutic targets for more effective treatment of influenza infections. \copyright 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.}

abstract = {Although annual influenza epidemics affect around 10\% of the global population, current treatment options are limited and development of new antivirals is needed. Here, using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we reveal the unique phosphoproteome dynamics that occur in the host cell within minutes of influenza A virus ({IAV}) infection. We uncover cellular kinases required for the observed signaling pattern and find that inhibition of selected candidates, such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ({GRK2}), leads to decreased {IAV} replication. As {GRK2} has emerged as drug target in heart disease, we focus on its role in {IAV} infection and show that it is required for viral uncoating. Replication of seasonal and pandemic {IAVs} is severely decreased by specific {GRK2} inhibitors in primary human airway cultures and in mice. Our study reveals the {IAV}-induced changes to the cellular phosphoproteome and identifies {GRK2} as crucial node of the kinase network that enables {IAV} replication.}

Elucidation of host factors required during virus infection provides information not only on the signaling pathways involved but also on the identification of novel drug targets. {RNA} interference screening method had been utilized by several studies to determine these host factors; however, proteomics data on influenza host factors are currently limited. In this study, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of human lung cell line (A549) infected with 2009 pandemic influenza virus A ({H1N1}) virus was performed. Phosphopeptides were enriched from tryptic digests of total protein of infected and mock-infected cells using a titania column on an automated purification system followed by {iTRAQ} labeling. Identification and quantitative analysis of {iTRAQ}-labeled phosphopeptides were performed using {LC}-{MS}/{MS}. We identified 366 phosphorylation sites on 283 proteins. Of these, we detected 43 upregulated and 35 downregulated proteins during influenza virus infection. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that majority of the identified proteins are phosphoproteins involved in {RNA} processing, immune system process and response to infection. Host-virus interaction network analysis had identified 23 densely connected subnetworks. Of which, 13 subnetworks contained proteins with altered phosphorylation levels during by influenza virus infection. Our results will help to identify potential drug targets that can be pursued for influenza antiviral drug development. Copyright \copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {All {RNA} viruses deliver their genomes into target host cells through processes distinct from normal trafficking of cellular {RNA} transcripts. The delivery of viral {RNA} into most cells hence triggers innate antiviral defenses that recognize viral {RNA} as foreign. In turn, viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert these defenses, allowing them to thrive in target cells. Therefore, drugs activating defense to foreign or exogenous {RNA} could serve as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Here we show that transcriptional signatures associated with cellular responses to the delivery of a non-viral exogenous {RNA} sequence into human cells predicts small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In particular, transcriptional responses to the delivery of cas9 {mRNA} into human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ({HSPCs}) highly matches those triggered by small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity such as emetine, homoharringtonine, pyrvinium pamoate and anisomycin, indicating that these drugs are potentially active against other {RNA} viruses. Furthermore, these drugs have been approved for other indications and could thereby be repurposed to novel viruses. We propose that the antiviral activity of these drugs to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 should therefore be determined as they have been shown as active against other coronaviruses including {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV}. These drugs could also be explored as potential adjuvants to {COVID}-19 vaccines in development due to their potential effect on the innate antiviral defenses that could bolster adaptive immunity when delivered alongside vaccine antigens.}

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized {SARS}-{CoV}-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}) isolated from {COVID}-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in {COVID}-19 derived {PBMCs}. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with {NKRF}, a {NF}-{kB} repressor, and may precipitate the strong {IL}-8/{IL}-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in {COVID}-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of {SARS}-{CoV}-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which {SARS}-{CoV}-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.}

As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 ({IL}-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated {COVID}-19 and that the anti-{IL}-6 biologic tocilizumab may be beneficial, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field. Methods: We systematically searched {MEDLINE} and {EMBASE} for studies investigating the immunological response in {COVID}-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models. Results: Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean {IL}-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated {COVID}-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95\%{CI}, 1.17-7.19; I2=100\%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe {COVID}-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed. Conclusions: In patients with {COVID}-19, {IL}-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of {IL}-6 with tocilizumab appears to be efficacious and safe in preliminary investigation, the results of several ongoing clinical trials should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in {COVID}-19 prior to routine clinical application.}

Here, we investigate {ACE2} and {TMPR\SS2} expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell {RNA} sequencing, respectively. While {TMPR\SS2} is expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches {ACE2} is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to {RHO} {GTPase} function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection.

The {3C}-like protease ({3CLpro}), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {3CLpro} by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {3CLpro} and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {3CLpro} determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a 'shield' in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.}

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) is a positive-stranded {RNA} betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global {SARS}-{CoV}-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory ({ORF8}) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect. The genetic structure determined for the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs.}

Here, we report that influenza viral pneumonia leads to chronic non-resolving lung pathology and exaggerated accumulation of {CD8}+ tissue-resident memory T cells ({TRM}) in the respiratory tract of aged hosts. {TRM} accumulation relies on elevated {TGF}-b; present in aged tissues. Further, we show that {TRM} isolated from aged lungs lack a subpopulation characterized by expression of molecules involved in {TCR} signaling and effector function. Consequently, {TRM} cells from aged lungs were insufficient to provide heterologous protective immunity. Strikingly, the depletion of {CD8}+ {TRM} cells dampens persistent chronic lung inflammation and ameliorates tissue fibrosis in aged, but not young, animals. Collectively, our data demonstrate that age-associated {TRM} cell malfunction supports chronic lung inflammatory and fibrotic sequelae following viral pneumonia in aged hosts.}

abstract = {The novel coronavirus 2019-{nCoV} has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of {COVID}-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that {ACE2} is a receptor for 2019-{nCoV}, and studies also suggested that high expression of {ACE2} may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization ({MR}) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to {ACE2} expression in the lung. Expression data was based on {GTEx}. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in {MR} analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter {ACE2} expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, {MR} is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased {ACE2} expression. Based on one of the largest {GWAS} on type {II} diabetes ({T2DM}) to date (N=898,130), we found that {T2DM} is causally linked to raised {ACE2} expression (beta=0.1835, 95\% {CI} 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.{49E}-4; {GSMR} method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p\textless0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and {II} diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased {ACE2} included inflammatory bowel disease, ({ER}+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated {ALT}, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered {ACE2} expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, {VEGF} signaling, {JAK}-{STAT} signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the {MR} analysis. In conclusion, the current {MR} analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect {ACE2} expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide {MR} analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying {ACE2} expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.}

abstract = {{COVID}-19 pandemic has underlined the impact of emergent pathogens as a major threat for human health. The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent {SARS}-{CoV}-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.}

abstract = {In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named {SARS}-{CoV}-2 first reported in Wuhan, China, emerged and rapidly spread to numerous other countries globally, causing the current pandemic. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract ({COVID}-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating {COVID}-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. In order for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 ({TMPR\SS2}) at the S2 site. We demonstrate that {TMPR\SS2} is essential for activation of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of {TMPR\SS2} expression. Further, we show that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of {TMPR\SS2} and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor {MI}-1851. Combining various {TMPR\SS2} inhibitors with {MI}-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication. Our data demonstrate that both {TMPR\SS2} and furin are essential for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of {COVID}-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and {TMPR\SS2} inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of {COVID}-19.}

abstract = {Introduction: A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) was recently identified as the pathogen responsible for the {COVID}-19 outbreak. {SARS}-{CoV}-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 is 80\% genetically identical to the 2003 {SARS}-{CoV} virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both {SARS}-{CoV} and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 into human cells. {ACE2} is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type {II} alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the {RAS} system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of {ACE2} gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodelling plays a significant role in the regulation of {ACE2} gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome. Methods: Here, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) and thus regulatory elements located within the {ACE2} gene. Results: We identified regulatory elements within {ACE2} that control the expression of {PIR}, {CA5B}, and {VSP13C} in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Conclusion: Our study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of {ACE2} alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.}

In the past decade, network medicine had developed a framework consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study host-pathogen interactions, unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection, identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates. Here, we adapt the network-based toolset to {COVID}-19, recovering the primary pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases. We predict that the virus can manifest itself in other tissues, such as the reproductive system, and brain regions, moreover we predict neurological comorbidities. We build on these findings to deploy three network-based drug repurposing strategies, relying on network proximity, diffusion, and {AI}-based metrics, allowing to rank all approved drugs based on their likely efficacy for {COVID}-19 patients, aggregate all predictions, and, thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing candidates. We validate the accuracy of our predictions using drugs currently in clinical trials, and an expression-based validation of selected candidates suggests that these drugs, with known toxicities and side effects, could be moved to clinical trials rapidly.}

abstract = {The emergence of novel {SARS} coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) in 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic of severe pneumonia-like disease designated as coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19). To date, more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and 139,500 deaths have been reported worldwide, and there are currently no medical countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease. As the development of a vaccine could require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is \textgreater10 years, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for {COVID}-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as {SARS}-{CoV}-2 antivirals, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or {FDAapproved} small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. These include the {PIKfyve} kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors {MDL}-28170, Z {LVG} {CHN2}, {VBY}-825, and {ONO} 5334, and the {CCR1} antagonist {MLN}-3897. Since many of these molecules have advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for {COVID}-19 treatment.}

The entry of {SARS}-{CoV} into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor ({ACE2}) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion 3,4 . The spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 also binds to {ACE2} with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear 5,6 . Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Compared with {SARS}-{CoV}, we found a {SPRR} insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that {ACE2} and {TMPR\SSs} are highly coexpressed in {AT2} cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and indicate its potential target cells.}

Besides social isolation, identification of the suitable clinically approved drugs to be repurposed could lead to short-term action to reduce mortality. The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 major protease (Mpro) is validated target over highly pathogenic {CoV}. {HIV} protease inhibitors, like lopinavir ({LPV}), also inhibit the 2002 {SARS}-{CoV} Mpro. However, limited evidence exist whether other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors may bind more efficiently to this enzyme to block {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication. Among these substances, atazanavir ({ATV}) has documented bioavailability into the respiratory tract, motivating further evaluation on its ability to impair {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication. Here, we describe that {ATV} docks stronger to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro active site than {LPV}, occupying the substrate cleft in the active side during the entire molecular dynamic analysis. {ATV} blocked Mpro activity in cell-free based assays at 10μM. In vitro assays with different cell types, Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and human primary monocytes, confirmed that {ATV}, combined or not with {RTV}, inhibited {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication. Moreover, these drugs performed better than chloroquine, recognized for its antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities, to reduce virus-induced {IL}-6 and {TNF}-\alpha levels. Our data highlights that {ATV} and {ATV}/{RTV} could be considered among the repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials against {COVID}-19.}

Using gene knockdown technology, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase {III\beta} ({PI4KB}) is required for cellular entry by pseudoviruses bearing the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}) spike protein and that the cell entry mediated by {SARS}-{CoV} spike protein is strongly inhibited by knockdown of {PI4KB}. Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibitors of {PI4KB} blocked entry of {SARS} pseudovirions. Further research suggested that {PI4P} plays an essential role in {SARS}-{CoV} spike-mediated entry, which is regulated by the {PI4P} lipid microenvironment. We further demonstrate that {PI4KB} does not affect virus entry at the {SARS}-{CoV} S-{ACE2} binding interface or at the stage of virus internalization but rather at or before virus fusion.

In addition, this genome also contains nine other potential {ORFs} varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids. The largest among these is the first {ORF} of the second longest subgenomic {RNA}, and this protein (termed U274 in the present study) consists of 274 amino acids and contains three putative transmembrane domains. Using antibody specific for the C terminus of U274, we show U274 to be expressed in {SARS}-{CoV}-infected Vero E6 cells and, in addition to the full-length protein, two other processed forms were also detected. By indirect immunofluorescence, U274 was localized to the perinuclear region, as well as to the plasma membrane, in both transfected and infected cells. Using an N terminus myc-tagged U274, the topology of U274 and its expression on the cell surface were confirmed. Deletion of a cytoplasmic domain of U274, which contains Yxxphi and diacidic motifs, abolished its transport to the cell surface. In addition, U274 expressed on the cell surface can internalize antibodies from the culture medium into the cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also showed that U274 could interact specifically with the M, E, and S structural proteins, as well as with U122, another protein that is unique to {SARS}-{CoV}.}

The {SARS}-{CoV} viral genome encodes several proteins which have no homology to proteins in any other coronaviruses, and a number of these proteins have been implicated in viral cytopathies. One such protein is 3a, which is also known as X1, {ORF3} and U274. 3a expression is detected in both {SARS}-{CoV} infected cultured cells and patients. Among the different functions identified, 3a is a capable of inducing apoptosis. We previously showed that caspase pathways are involved in 3a-induced apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to find out protein domains on 3a that are essential for its pro-apoptotic function. Protein sequence analysis reveals that 3a possesses three major protein signatures, the cysteine-rich, Yxx phi and diacidic domains. We showed that 3a proteins carrying respective mutations in these protein domains exhibit reduced pro-apoptotic activities, indicating the importance of these domains on 3a's pro-apoptotic function. It was previously reported that 3a possesses potassium ion channel activity. We further demonstrated that the blockade of 3a's potassium channel activity abolished caspase-dependent apoptosis. This report provides the first evidence that ion channel activity of 3a is required for its pro-apoptotic function. As ion channel activity has been reported to regulate apoptosis in different pathologic conditions, finding ways to modulate the ion channel activity may offer a new direction toward the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by {SARS}-{CoV}.}

However, despite its small size, the application of Nb6 protein in infected cells is greatly limited, as the protein itself cannot enter the cells physically. In this study, a trans-activating transduction ({TAT}) peptide was fused with Nb6 to promote protein entry into cells. {TAT}-Nb6 was expressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli, and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and pulldown assays showed that E. coli-expressed {TAT}-Nb6 maintained the binding ability to E. coli-expressed or {PRRSV}-encoded Nsp9.

In addition, {TAT}-Nb6 fusion protein could suppress the replication of various {PRRSV} strains in {MARC}-145 cells and {PAMs}.

The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as \beta-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus {NL63} infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus {NL63} ({HCoV}-{NL63}) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect ({CPE}) and virus yield ({IC50} = 0.64 μg/{mL}) in {HCoV}-{NL63}-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the {HCoV}-{NL63} infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B ({5aR}-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the {CPE} and progeny virus production. The {IC50} values against virus yield were 1.52 μM and 2.60 μM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of {HCoV}-{NL63} replication, particularly by blocking viral {RNA} genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin ({IC50} = 0.06 μM) and indigodole B ({IC50} = 2.09 μM) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well. This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of S. cusia leaf methanol extract that acted against {HCoV}-{NL63} in a cell-type independent manner. The results specify that tryptanthrin possesses antiviral potential against {HCoV}-{NL63} infection.}

abstract = {Coronaviruses encode multiple interferon antagonists that modulate the host response to virus replication. Here, we evaluated the host transcriptional response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in one of two different viral antagonists: the deubiquitinase ({DUB}) within nonstructural protein 3 or the endoribonuclease ({EndoU}) within nonstructural protein 15. We used transcriptomics approaches to compare the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild-type, {DUBmut}, and {EndoUmut} viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the {EndoUmut} virus activates a focused response predominantly involving type I interferons and interferon-related genes, whereas the {WT} and {DUBmut} viruses more broadly stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including networks associated with activating the unfolded protein response ({UPR}), and the proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivating a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages.{ImportanceMacrophages} are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they "notice" the infection and respond by inducing type I interferons, which limits virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell's ability to signal an interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses: one with reduced deubiquitinating activity ({DUBmut}) and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease ({EndoUmut}). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the {EndoUmut} virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-related genes. In contrast, wild-type virus and the {DUBmut} virus elicited a more limited interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including players in the unfolded protein response and pro-inflammatory pathways associated with progression of significant disease. This study reveals that {EndoU} activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to evade the host innate response and to replicate in macrophages.

abstract = {Respiratory {RNA} viruses are responsible for recurrent acute respiratory illnesses that still represent a major medical need. Previously we developed a large variety of benzimidazole derivatives able to inhibit these viruses. Herein, two series of (thio)semicarbazone- and hydrazone-based benzimidazoles have been explored, by derivatizing 5-acetyl benzimidazoles previously reported by us, thereby evaluating the influence of the modification on the antiviral activity. Compounds 6, 8, 16 and 17, bearing the 5-(thio)semicarbazone and 5-hydrazone functionalities in combination with the 2-benzyl ring on the benzimidazole core structure, acted as dual inhibitors of influenza A virus and human coronavirus. For respiratory syncytial virus ({RSV}), activity is limited to the 5-thiosemicarbazone (25) and 5-hydrazone (22) compounds carrying the 2-[(benzotriazol-1/2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole scaffold. These molecules proved to be the most effective antiviral agents, able to reach the potency profile of the licensed drug ribavirin. The molecular docking analysis explained the {SAR} of these compounds around their binding mode to the target {RSV} F protein, revealing the key contacts for further assessment. The herein-investigated benzimidazole-based derivatives may represent valuable hit compounds, deserving subsequent structural improvements towards more efficient antiviral agents for the treatment of pathologies caused by these human respiratory viruses.}

However, whether 9b protein is a structural component of {SARS}-{CoV} particles remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 9b protein is translated from bicistronic {mRNA9} via leaky ribosome scanning and it is incorporated into both virus-like particles ({VLPs}) and purified {SARS}-{CoV} virions. Further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9b protein into {VLPs} is dependent upon the co-expression of E and M proteins, but not upon the presence of either S or N protein. Our data indicate that 9b protein of {SARS}-{CoV} is another virion-associated accessory protein. This finding will lead to a better understanding of the properties of the {SARS}-{CoV} 9b protein.}

abstract = {As the outbreak of {COVID}-19 has accelerated, an urgent need for finding strategies to combat the virus is growing. Thus, gaining more knowledge on the pathogenicity mechanism of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, the causing agent of {COVID}-19, and its interaction with the immune system is of utmost importance. Although this novel virus is not well known yet, its structural and genetic similarity with {SARS}-{CoV} as well as the comparable pattern of age-mortality relations suggest that the previous findings on {SARS} can be applicable for {COVID}-19. Therefore, a systems biology study was conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism for the differences in the age-specific mortality of {SARS} and the most important signaling pathways activated by the virus. The results were then validated through a literature review on {COVID}-19 and the other closely related viruses, {SARS} and {MERS}. Interferons have shown to possess a crucial role in the defense against coronavirus diseases. The virus can impede the interferon induction in humans. Moreover, {STAT1}, a key protein in the interferon mediated immune response, is antagonized by the virus. This could explain the increased response threshold of immune cells to {IFNs} during {CoV} infections. A vivid correlation between the innate immune response threshold and the fatality rates in {COVID}-19 can be found. Differences in the dynamics of the interferons-related innate immune responses in children, adults and elderly may explain the reported fatality rates. The increased mortality rates in the elderly can be explained by the higher threshold of interferon-mediated immune responses. Earlier induction of interferons in children and their less developed immune system could be the reason behind their zero or near to zero fatality rate. Administration of interferon-inducing agents, such as Poly ({ICLC}), could reduce the mortality of {SARS} at the very early stages of the disease. Adding interferon-\gamma to an interferon-I, as a synergistic combination therapy, might maximize the benefits.At the later stages of the disease, however, the balance of the immune reactions would be disrupted and the responses would shift toward immnopathogenic over-reactions and probably cytokine storm. Moderating the activity of the immune system and supportive care in such conditions might be the optimum approach.}

In this study, we presented a novel network based drug repurposing platform to identify potential drugs for the treatment of {COVID}-2019. We first analysed the genome sequence of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and identified {SARS} as the closest disease, based on genome similarity between both causal viruses, followed by {MERS} and other human coronavirus diseases. Using our {AutoSeed} pipeline (text mining and database searches), we obtained 34 {COVID}-2019-related genes. Taking those genes as seeds, we automatically built a molecular network for which our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules and finally suggested 78 drugs to repurpose. Following manual filtering based on clinical knowledge, we re-prioritized 30 potential repurposable drugs against {COVID}-2019 (including pseudoephedrine, andrographolide, chloroquine, abacavir, and thalidomide) .

Prion-like domains are critical for virulence and the development of therapeutic targets; however, the prion-like domains in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteome have not been analyzed. In this in silico study, using the {PLAAC} algorithm, we identified the presence of prion-like domains in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike protein. Compared with other viruses, a striking difference was observed in the distribution of prion-like domains in the spike, since {SARS}-{CoV}-2 was the only coronavirus with a prion-like domain found in the receptor-binding domain of the S1 region of the spike protein. The presence and unique distribution of prion-like domains in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor-binding domains of spike proteins is particularly interesting, since although {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and {SARS}-{CoV} S share the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}), {SARS}-{CoV}-2 demonstrates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for {ACE2}. Finally, we identified prion-like domains in the \alpha1 helix of the {ACE2} receptor that interacts with the viral receptor-binding domain of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the identified {PrDs} in the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) and {ACE2} region that interacts with {RBD} have important functional roles in viral adhesion and entry.}

In this study, the coronavirus pathogenicity and the losartan functional ligand for inhibiting {TRPM2} and macrodomain have been molecularly evaluated.Material and method: In this study, the structures of macrodomain binding {ADP} ribose in {CoVs} and human Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 2 ({TRPM2}) protein were downloaded from protein data bank. Then, a virtual screening was done to recognize the hit compounds from {GalaXi\_2019}-10, {KnowledgeSpace\_2019}-05, and {REALspace\_2019}-12 databases. This collection, then, was imported to the {ligandScout} software, on the base of Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose ({ADPR}) pharmacophore model. Result: Among seven compounds, five compounds were finally evaluated as the structural analogs of {ADPR} or other nucleotides, from which one compound was a non-{FDA}-approved sulphonamide and was removed. The other compound, losartan, was finally selected for molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation. According to the virtual screening and docking, losartan was candidate as an effective ligand for {TRPM2} and macrodomain. Conclusion: In the current study losartan earned a proper dock score and binding affinity to create the complexes with {TRPM2} and macrodomain. The inhibitory effect of losartan on {PARP} has been shown and it could interfere positively in several points ({PARP}, {PARG}- macrodomain and {TRPM2}) and decreases oxidative stress and apoptosis in {COVID}-19.}

Methods: Molecular docking protocols have been used to rapidly screen {FDA} database for high affinity interaction at the {SARS}-{CoV}-2-{RBD}/{ACE}-2 interface. One of the top candidate ubrogepant has been using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation method. Results: Molecular docking result showed that ubrogepant ({UBR}) and darunavir have binding energies of -10.4 kcal/mol. {MMPBSA} free energy analyses of {UBR} bound to {RBD}, {ACE}-2 and {RBD}/{ACE}-2 revealed {RBD}/{ACE}-2 \textgreater {ACE}-2 \textgreater {RBD} preference. Network analysis showed that interaction captured in the crystal structure were disrupted in {UBR}-bound state, hydration of the interface and increased atomic fluctuation within the {RBD} oligomerization interface and {ACE}-2 zinc binding site. Conclusions: The ability of ubrogepant to rupture the interaction at the {RBD}/{ACE}-2 interface residues of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD}/{ACE}-2 complex may result in loss of protein function with direct implication on oligomerization formation in {RBD} and loss of function in {ACE}-2 thus, making binding, cellular receptor recognition impossible. General Significance: Ubrogepant represents a new therapeutic candidate in the fight against {COVID}-19, as it binds with relatively high affinity with free {RBD}, {ACE}-2 receptor and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 {RBD}/{ACE}-2 complex based on binding affinity calculations}

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 19 ({COVID}-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 (2019-{nCoV}). While no drugs have yet been approved to treat this disease, small molecules effective against other viral infections are under clinical evaluation for therapeutic abatement of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections. Ongoing clinical trials include Kaletra (a combination of two protease inhibitors approved for {HIV} treatment), remdesivir (an investigational drug targeting {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase [{RdRP}] of {SARS}-{CoV}-2), and hydroxychloroquine (an approved anti-malarial and immuno-modulatory drug). Since {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication depends on three virally encoded proteins ({RdRP}, papain-like proteinase, and helicase), we screened 54 {FDA}-approved antiviral drugs and \~3300 investigational drugs for binding to these proteins using targeted and unbiased docking simulations and computational modeling. Elbasvir, a drug approved for treating hepatitis C, is predicted to bind stably and preferentially to all three proteins. At the therapeutic dosage, elbasvir has low toxicity (liver enzymes transiently elevated in 1\% of subjects) and well-characterized drug-drug interactions. We predict that treatment with elbasvir, alone or in combination with other drugs such as grazoprevir, could efficiently block {SARS}-{CoV}-2 replication. The concerted action of elbasvir on at least three targets essential for viral replication renders viral mutation to drug resistance extremely unlikely.}

The results of numerous studies have shown that protease inhibitors and compounds, which make up the major part of plant derivatives, especially terpenoids, can therefore be very effective in controlling virus-induced infection. The aim of this research is the bioinformatical study of {COVID\_19} inhibition by terpenoids of plant origin. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive-analytic study. In the present study , the structure of terpene comounds and {COVID\_19} protease was received from the databases such as {PubChem} and Protein Data Bank ({PDB}). After that, molecular docking was performed by {MVD}(molegro virtual docker) software. Results: The results are identified to have inhibitory activities against novel {COVID}-19 protease. Of these compounds, Ginkgolide A has a stronger bond and high affinity with protease Conclusion: Finally, with due attention to the high effectiveness function of terpenoids, we can conclude that these compounds may be considered as effectire {COVID\_19} antiprotease drugs}

abstract = {Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has posed tremendous challenges to the world's public health. The conditions of some patients can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Current studies suggest that an outbreak of inflammatory response known as cytokine storm may play a key role in the process. This study was performed to investigate the relativity of the production of circulating microparticles ({cMPs}) and the expression of inflammatory factors (interleukin [{IL}]-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10) expression in the blood on the degree of {COVID}-19. Methods A total of 89 patients infected with {SARS}-{CoV}-2 were divided into four groups, namely, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill groups, according to China's {COVID}-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program (6th trial version), and 30 healthy persons were selected as the control group. The groups were compared in terms of {cMP} production and {IL}-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10 levels in their blood, and the correlation between {cMP} production and the expression of inflammatory factors with the degree of {COVID}-19 were analysed. Results Differences in {cMP} production and {IL}-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10 expression levels among the five groups were statistically significant (P\textless0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between {cMP} production or the expression of {IL}-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10 and the degree of {COVID}-19 ({cMP}, r=0.981; {IL}-6, r=0.954; {IL}-8, r=0.863; {IL}-10, r=0.895; P\textless0.05). Conclusion Increased levels of {cMP}, {IL}-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10 aggravate {COVID}-19. {cMP} production and the expression of {IL}-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10 may predict the degree of {COVID}-19 to a certain extent. The early inhibition of {cMP} overproduction and {IL}-6, {IL}-8 and {IL}-10 expression may be an important therapeutic target for the prevention of {COVID}-19 progression.}

Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence. {METHODS}: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone ({HC}) or with azithromycin ({HC}+{AZ}) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented. {RESULTS}: A total of 368 patients were evaluated ({HC}, n=97; {HC}+{AZ}, n=113; no {HC}, n=158). Rates of death in the {HC}, {HC}+{AZ}, and no {HC} groups were 27.8\%, 22.1\%, 11.4\%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the {HC}, {HC}+{AZ}, and no {HC} groups were 13.3\%, 6.9\%, 14.1\%, respectively. Compared to the no {HC} group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the {HC} group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95\% {CI}, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the {HC}+{AZ} group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95\% {CI}, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the {HC} group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95\% {CI}, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the {HC}+{AZ} group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95\% {CI}, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no {HC} group. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.}

The specific goal of track 4 was to evaluate text mining systems capable of automatically constructing {BEL} statements from given evidence text, and of retrieving evidence text for given {BEL} statements. Given the complexity of the task, we designed an evaluation methodology which gives credit to partially correct statements. We identified various levels of information expressed by {BEL} statements, such as entities, functions, relations, and introduced an evaluation framework which rewards systems capable of delivering useful {BEL} fragments at each of these levels. The aim of this evaluation method is to help identify the characteristics of the systems which, if combined, would be most useful for achieving the overall goal of automatically constructing causal biological networks from text. \copyright The Author(s) 2016.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with {COVID}-19 hospitalized in a {US} health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of patients with {COVID}-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system. The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates. Exposures: Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results: A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range \{{IQR\}}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7\% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6\%), obesity (1737; 41.7\%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8\%). At triage, 30.7\% of patients were febrile, 17.3\% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/minute, and 27.8\% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1\%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2\%) (median age, 68 years [{IQR}, 56-78]; 33.5\% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2\%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21\%) died. Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1\%. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days ({IQR}, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2\%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days ({IQR}, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [{IQR}, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days ({IQR}, 2.4-8.1). Conclusions and Relevance: This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed {COVID}-19 in the New York City area.}

The levels of both {TC} and {HDL} were inversely associated with the severity of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infection. In addition, in patients with severe disease, a significant increase in the serum {HDL} level was correlated with good outcomes. We also showed that a clinically approved {HDLR} antagonist inhibited {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pseudovirus infection. Notably, {SARS}-2-S bound to cholesterol.

abstract = {Scientific models describe natural phenomena at different levels of abstraction. Abstract descriptions can provide the basis for interventions on the system and explanation of observed phenomena at a level of granularity that is coarser than the most fundamental account of the system. Beckers and Halpern (2019), building on work of Rubenstein et al. (2017), developed an account of abstraction for causal models that is exact. Here we extend this account to the more realistic case where an abstract causal model offers only an approximation of the underlying system. We show how the resulting account handles the discrepancy that can arise between low- and high-level causal models of the same system, and in the process provide an account of how one causal model approximates another, a topic of independent interest. Finally, we extend the account of approximate abstractions to probabilistic causal models, indicating how and where uncertainty can enter into an approximate abstraction.}

abstract = {Missing data is a pervasive problem in data analyses, resulting in datasets that contain censored realizations of a target distribution. Many approaches to inference on the target distribution using censored observed data, rely on missing data models represented as a factorization with respect to a directed acyclic graph. In this paper we consider the identifiability of the target distribution within this class of models, and show that the most general identification strategies proposed so far retain a significant gap in that they fail to identify a wide class of identifiable distributions. To address this gap, we propose a new algorithm that significantly generalizes the types of manipulations used in the {ID} algorithm [14, 16], developed in the context of causal inference, in order to obtain identification.}

abstract = {The {BioCreative}-V community proposed a challenging task of automatic extraction of causal relation network in Biological Expression Language ({BEL}) from the biomedical literature. Previous studies on this task largely used models induced from other related tasks and then transformed intermediate structures to {BEL} statements, which left the given training corpus unexplored. To make full use of the {BEL} training corpus, in this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to extract {BEL} statements. Specifically, we decompose the problem into two subtasks: entity relation extraction and entity function detection. First, two attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks models are used to extract entity relation and entity function, respectively. Then entity relation and their functions are combined into a {BEL} statement. In order to boost the overall performance, a strategy of threshold filtering is applied to improve the precision of identified entity functions. We evaluate our approach on the {BioCreative}-V Track 4 corpus with or without gold entities. The experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1-measure of 46.9\% in stage 2 and 21.3\% in stage 1, respectively.}

abstract = {A large variety of molecular interactions occurs between biomolecular components in cells. When one or a cascade of molecular interactions results in a regulatory effect, by one component onto a downstream component, a so-called \textquoteleftcausal interaction\textquoteright takes place. Causal interactions constitute the building blocks in our understanding of larger regulatory networks in cells. These causal interactions and the biological processes they enable (e.g., gene regulation) need to be described with a careful appreciation of molecular interactions that occur between entities. A proper description of this information enables archiving, sharing, and reuse by humans and for computational science. Various representations of causal relationships between biological components are currently used in a variety of resources. Here, we propose a checklist that accommodates current representations, and call it the Minimum Information about a Molecular Interaction {CAusal} {STatement} ({MI2CAST}). This checklist defines both the required core information, as well as a comprehensive set of other contextual details valuable to the end user and relevant for reusing and reproducing causal molecular interaction information. The {MI2CAST} checklist can be used as reporting guidelines when annotating and curating causal statements, while assuring uniformity and interoperability of the data across resources.}

Four {SARS}-{CoV} {PLpro} lead inhibitors were tested against {MERS}-{CoV} {PLpro}, none of which were effective against {MERS}-{CoV} {PLpro}. Structure and sequence alignments revealed that two residues, Y269 and Q270, responsible for inhibitor binding to {SARS}-{CoV} {PLpro}, were replaced by T274 and A275 in {MERS}-{CoV} {PLpro}, making critical binding interactions difficult to form for similar types of inhibitors. High-throughput screening ({HTS}) of 25 000 compounds against both {PLpro} enzymes identified a small fragment-like noncovalent dual inhibitor. Mode of inhibition studies by enzyme kinetics and competition surface plasmon resonance ({SPR}) analyses suggested that this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor with an {IC50} of 6 μM against {MERS}-{CoV} {PLpro}, indicating that it binds to the active site, whereas it acts as an allosteric inhibitor against {SARS}-{CoV} {PLpro} with an {IC50} of 11 μM. These results raised the possibility that inhibitor recognition specificity of {MERS}-{CoV} {PLpro} may differ from that of {SARS}-{CoV} {PLpro}. In addition, inhibitory activity of this compound was selective for {SARS}-{CoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} {PLpro} enzymes over two human homologues, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases 1 and 3 ({hUCH}-L1 and {hUCH}-L3).}

abstract = {We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2 virus. We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in {COVID}-19 patients. Specifically the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on the disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the {COVID}-19 patients are more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in {COVID}-19 patients while enhancing the viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in {COVID}-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high risk {COVID}-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.

abstract = {Knowledge graph construction consists of two tasks: extracting information from external resources (knowledge population) and inferring missing information through a statistical analysis on the extracted information (knowledge completion). In many cases, insufficient external resources in the knowledge population hinder the subsequent statistical inference. The gap between these two processes can be reduced by an incremental population approach. We propose a new probabilistic knowledge graph factorisation method that benefits from the path structure of existing knowledge (e.g. syllogism) and enables a common modelling approach to be used for both incremental population and knowledge completion tasks. More specifically, the probabilistic formulation allows us to develop an incremental population algorithm that trades off exploitation-exploration. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the balanced exploitation-exploration helps the incremental population, and the additional path structure helps to predict missing information in knowledge completion.},

We predict spermatogonial cells and prostate endocrine cells, but not ovarian cells, to be highly permissive to {SARS}-{CoV}-2, suggesting male-specific vulnerabilities. Early stages of embryonic and placental development show a moderate risk of infection. The nasal epithelium looks like another battleground, characterized by high expression of both promoting and restriction factors and a potential age-dependent shift in {SCARF} expression.

The disease in notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. The molecular mechanism as to why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Understanding these differences is critical for safeguarding the vulnerable and guiding effective policy and treatments. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E ({apoE}) enhances the endocytic entry of pseudotyped {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Super resolution imaging of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 entry point with high cholesterol showed markedly increased apparent diameter (\~10\% to 100 nm) and almost twice the total number of viral entry points. The cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme ({ACE2}) to the viral entry site where {SARS}-{CoV}-2 docks to properly exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, we show cholesterol enhances binding of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to the cell surface which increases association with the endocytic pathway. Decreasing cellular cholesterol has the opposite effect. Based on these findings and known loading of cholesterol into peripheral tissue cholesterol during aging and inflammation, we build a cholesterol dependent model for {COVID19} lethality in elderly and the chronically ill. As cholesterol increases with age and inflammation (e.g. smoking and diabetes), the cell surface is coated with viral entry points and optimally assembled viral entry proteins. Importantly our model suggests high levels of cholesterol is most alarming in the tissue, not the blood. In fact, rapidly dropping cholesterol in the blood may indicate severe loading of cholesterol in peripheral tissue and a dangerous situation for escalated {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infectivity. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ({PUFAs}) oppose the effects of cholesterol and provide a molecular basis for eating healthy diets to avoid severe cases of {COVID19}.}
